# Generating unique IDs

Sometimes you might need to generate a unique id for elements. We'll talk about the how and the why in this lesson.

## What is a unique string

A unique string is a string with many numbers and characters. It has so many characters that it is almost impossible to create the same string twice.

Here's what a unique strings look like:

```js
const string1 = '577ac755d7fef11100753579'
const string2 = '5b4ef18839cd6500114e04d2'
```

Since the string is unique, they are often used as an identifier. Hence unique IDs.

## Creating a unique string

You can use this code to generate a unique string:

```js
const generateUnique = length =>
  Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 2 + length)
```

This code generates a unique string between 1 to 10 characters. The `length` argument determines the numbers of characters generated.

```js
console.log(generateUnique(5)) // p9hdi
console.log(generateUnique(10)) // lyv38rpujn
```

We'll break down this code so you understand what it does.

There are three parts:

1. `Math.random`
2. `toString`
3. `substring`

### Math.random

`Math.random` is a JavaScript method to produce a random number from 0 to 1. It produces a number with around 16 decimal points. I say around because `Math.random` is not consistent.

```js
console.log(Math.random()) // 0.21488604415320722
console.log(Math.random()) // 0.5658986096492693
```

### toString

`toString` converts the random number into a string. Every number in JavaScript contains this `toString` method. It takes in an argument called a `radix`.

```js
Number.toString(radix)
```

A `radix` (or base) is the number of unique digits used in a numeric system. We have many times of numeric systems.

For example:

1. Booleans have two digits: 0 and 1. They use a `radix` of 2.
2. Our normal numeric system has 10 digits: 0-9. This uses a `radix` of 10.
3. The hexadecimal numeric system we use for colors has  16 digits: 0-9 and a-f. This uses a `radix` of 16.

If you've read about programming, you may have heard about Base 36 and Base 64. Here's what they mean:

1. Base 36 contains 36 digits: the 10 numbers and 26 lower-case letters. 0-9 and a-z.
2. Base 64 contains 64 digits: the 10 numbers, both upper and lower-case letters, and the `+` and `/` characters.

When you use `toString` method that exists on a Number, you can use a `radix` between 2 and 36.

Since we're trying to create a unique string, we want to use the highest number of characters possible. That's why we use 36 as the radix.

```js
console.log(Math.random().toString(36)) // 0.w4zqan9h1pr
console.log(Math.random().toString(36)) // 0.atfa2xdtzw
```

Remember `Math.random` generates around 16 decimal points? This 16 decimal points becomes 10-11 characters after `toString`.

### substring

`substring` lets you select part of a string. It can take up to two variables:

```js
String.substring(indexStart, indexEnd)
```

`indexStart` tells `substring` where to start the selection.

`indexEnd` tells `substring` where to stop the selection. This character at this index will not be part of the selection. If you did not provide `indexEnd`, JavaScript returns all remaining characters.

Example:

```js
console.log('My name is Zell'.substring(1)) // y name is Zell
console.log('My name is Zell'.substring(3, 7)) // name
```

In `generateUnique`, we used set `indexStart` to 2 and an `indexEnd` to `2 + length`

```js
const generateUnique = length =>
  Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 2 + length)
```

Setting `indexStart` to 2 gives us the first character after the decimal point. We don't want index 0 or 1 because the first two characters are always `0.`.

Setting `indexEnd` to `2 + length` lets us change the number of characters for the unique string. A higher number creates a string that is more unique.

## Why use unique IDs?

Let's explain why you need a unique id through an example.

Let's say you want to create a list of items with JavaScript. Each item needs to have an `id` because you need to do something with `id` later.

Here's the HTML most of us will think of.

```html
<ul>
  <li id="fruit-0">Apple</li>
  <li id="fruit-1">Banana</li>
  <li id="fruit-2">Orange</li>
</ul>
```

To create this HTML, we can use the `index` of the item.

```js
const fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange']
const ul = document.querySelector('.ul')

fruits.forEach((fruit, index) => {
  const li = document.createElement('li')
  li.textContent = fruit
  li.id = `fruit-${index}`
  ul.appendChild(li)
})
```

Here's a question. What happens if you need to create the fourth fruit later?

Most of us will have an urge to continue the indexing. To create the fourth fruit, we need to

1. Find the id of the last fruit
2. Get the id
3. Extract the number from the id
4. Increase the number by one
5. Set this new number as the id of the new item.

(If this sounds tedious, it is. I'm not going to show how to do it. That's not the point).

Here's another question. What happens if you need to delete the second fruit. Will you be comfortable with a list with a missing number?

```html
<ul>
  <li id="fruit-0">Apple</li>
  <li id="fruit-2">Orange</li>
</ul>
```

This shows a flaw in the numbering system.

A more robust system uses unique strings. We don't care if elements are added or deleted. They're going to be unique anyway.

```js
const fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange']
const ul = document.querySelector('.ul')

fruits.forEach((fruit, index) => {
  const li = document.createElement('li')
  li.textContent = fruit
  li.id = generateUnique(5)
  ul.appendChild('li')
})
```

```html
<ul>
  <li id="v00o0">Apple</li>
  <li id="6k9fz">Banana</li>
  <li id="j41vt">Orange</li>
</ul>
```

Note: You won't need to create your unique ID most of the time. These ids are usually generated on the backend, and you'll be able to get them when you need them. More details in the Ajax module.

## Here's a fun fact

I didn't know how to create a unique string before I wrote this lesson.

So I googled.

I found a method on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/105034/how-to-create-a-guid-uuid-in-javascript) and I got totally confused. I saw people used `Math.random`, `toString` and `substring`, but I didn't know what was happening.

So I took everything apart step by step like I showed you in this lesson. And I was able to understand it.

The moral of the story: you don't need to be perfect when it comes to JavaScript. You can google if you need to. And if you see something you don't understand, you can take it apart to understand it.
