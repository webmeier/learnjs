# 🛠️ Building the autocomplete (Part 2)

Which will you try first when you type your country?

1. The full name of your country
2. Your country code

We are probably conditioned to type the full name of our countries when we enter a form. This is because most forms don't accept country codes.

But lazy people (like me) may still prefer to type their country code if possible. From a UX perspective, we want to cater to these people. It makes the component much easier to use!

### Filtering based on country code

We need to filter based on two things now:

1. The name of the country
2. The country code

This means we need to change the callback we passed into `filter`.

We want to show the country if the typed value matches either the name of the country or the country code. We can use the OR operator to do so.

```js
input.addEventListener('input', event => {
  const matches = countries.filter(country =>
    country.name.toLowerCase().startsWith(val) ||
    country.code.toLowerCase().startsWith(val)
  )
})
```

Now, try typing `us` in the autocomplete. You'll see United States in dropdown :)
