# üõ†Ô∏è Improving the autocomplete

When a user types into the autocomplete, we want to highlight what they typed in the dropdown. This makes it easier for their minds to connect what they typed with the autocomplete suggestions.

Before:

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/autocomplete/basic/autocomplete.gif" alt="Autocomplete doesn't highlight the typed text">
  <figcaption aria-hidden>Autocomplete doesn't highlight the typed text</figcaption>
</figure>

After:

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/autocomplete/bold/autocomplete.gif" alt="Autocomplete highlights the typed text">
  <figcaption aria-hidden>Autocomplete highlights the typed text</figcaption>
</figure>

## How do you bold text?

There are two ways.

1. Wrap the text with a `<strong>` element
2. Style the text with `font-weight: bold`

```html
<!-- Method 1 -->
<p>Some text is <strong>bold</strong>.</p>

<!-- Method 2 -->
<p>Some text is <span style="font-weight: bold">bold</span>.</p>
```

We'll use method 1 since it's more straightforward.

## Making search terms bold

Here's the code we have now:

```js
autocomplete.addEventListener('input', event => {
  // ...
  dropdown.innerHTML = countries.filter(country => {
    return country.name.toLowerCase().startsWith(val)
  })
    .map(match => `<li>${match.name}</li>`)
    .join('')
})
```

To make the search terms bold, we can change the dropdown item's HTML.

```js
autocomplete.addEventListener('input', event => {
  // ...
  dropdown.innerHTML = countries.filter(country => {
    return country.name.toLowerCase().startsWith(val)
  })
    .map(match => {
      // Change the dropdown HTML
      const innerHTML = 'The HTML with bold search terms'
      return `<li>${innerHTML}</li>`
    })
    .join('')
})
```

Your first instinct will be to edit the callback we passed into the `map` function. Don't do it. It'll get confusing.

Why? If you write a `console.log` statement in a loop, the console will create one log entry for each item in the loop. If your loop is huge, you'll have to sieve through many `console.log` statements.

The easiest way to work on making search terms bold is to focus on one item at a time. For this lesson, we'll use United States.

If the user typed `u` in the autocomplete, we want to bold the `U` in United states. The HTML should be:

```html
<li><strong>U</strong>nited States</li>
```

If the user typed `Un` in the autocomplete, we want to bold both `U` and `n`.

```html
<li><strong>Un</strong>ited States</li>
```

If the user typed `Uni` in the autocomplete, we want to bold `U`, `n` and `i`.The HTML should be:

```html
<li><strong>Uni</strong>ted States</li>
```

Did you notice there's a pattern?

The number of typed characters is the same number of characters that are bold.

When you work on logic-related problems, you want to write down possible cases. Then, check if there's a solution that solves all your cases. We have one in this case.

We know the number of typed characters is the same as the number of bold characters. We can use the length of `val` to bold `country.name`.

Let's do it together.

### Bolding a search term

First, we'll create variables for the search term and the country name.

```js
const searchTerm = 'Uni'
const country = 'United States'
```

Here's the result we want:

```html
<strong>Uni</strong>ted States
```

To make the result string, need to isolate the characters that will be bold. This will be `Uni`. There are three characters in `uni`. We can get the number of letters from `uni` with `length`.

```js
const length = searchTerm.length
console.log(length) // 3
```

We can get `Uni` from `country` with the `substring` method. We can get the rest (`ted States`) with `substring` too.

```js
const toBold = country.substring(0, length)
console.log(toBold) // Uni
```

```js
const rest = country.substring(length)
console.log(rest) //ted States
```

Finally, we can make the result string with template literals.

```js
const resultString = `<strong>${toBold}</strong>${rest}`
console.log(resultString) // <strong>Uni</strong>ted States
```

### Bolding all search terms

We can convert the code above into a function because we need to use it many times. Here's one implementation of the function.

```js
const boldSearchTerms = (str, searchTerm) => {
  const length = searchTerm.length
  const toBold = str.substring(0, length)
  const rest = str.substring(length)
  return `<strong>${toBold}</strong>${rest}`
}
```

We can use `boldSearchTerms` this way:

```js
const result = boldSearchTerms('United States', 'uni')
console.log(result) = // <strong>Uni</strong>ted States
```

We can bold all search terms by using `boldSearchTerms` in the `map` function.

```js
autocomplete.addEventListener('input', event => {
  // ...
  dropdown.innerHTML = countries.filter(/* ... */)
    .map(match => {
       return `<li>${boldSearchTerms(match.name, val)}</li>`
    })
    .join('')
})
```
