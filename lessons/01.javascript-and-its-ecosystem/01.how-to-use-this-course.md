# Welcome to Learn JavaScript!

I'm thrilled to see you here. I promise that Learn JavaScript is going to be one of your best investment this year.

When you complete Learn JavaScript, you'll be confident with JavaScript, you'll be able to make anything you want from scratch, and you'll remember JavaScript for life.

I dare say you'll love Learn JavaScript so much that you'll want to tell everyone about it.

## Here's how to best use the course

It is my pleasure to help you learn JavaScript. Before you move into the lessons proper, I have a seven tips to help you supercharge your learning process:

1. Learn a bit of JavaScript everyday
2. Go through the theory sections slowly
3. Do every exercise you encounter
4. Ask questions, share your answers, and teach others
5. Code along, then build it once more
6. Take breaks
7. Form accountability groups

### Learn a bit of JavaScript everyday

Set aside 30-60mins a day to learn JavaScript.

Keep this learning period free of distractions. Shut the door, and tell your family you need time alone if necessary. Focus is paramount to learning.

Make sure you're in a fresh state. If you feel tired, you won't learn much. If it helps, you can try waking up 30-60mins earlier to learn (if you do this, make sure you sleep earlier too).

### Go through the theory slowly

Theory lessons are there to help you build your foundations so you know what to do when reach the practical lessons.

**Take your time. Read through the theory slowly, word for word.**

Make sure you understand a lesson (or even a section of the lesson) before you move on into the next one.

If you feel confused, ask immediately. You have a support group—the private community—in this course. Make use of it. You can get access to the community in README.md.

Do not move on until your confusion is cleared up. If you're confused, you won't be able to learn the next thing well.

Write down what you learned in your own words when you complete a lesson. Writing gives you more clarity, and helps you retain the lesson for a longer period.

The next day, summarize what you've learned the previous day before you start the next lesson. This helps you etch lesson deeper into your brain.

### Do the exercises

Some lessons contain exercises. Do them. They'll help you solidify the knowledge you've gained.

Post your answers to the community and ask for help if you're unsure. The community is there to help you learn.

Answers are not provided for the exercises because you learn better when you ask and teach.

### Teach others

If you get a chance to answer a question, do it.

When you answer a question, you recall the lesson from your memory, rephrase it in your own words again, and simplify it for the learner. This process helps you learn better, and retain knowledge for a longer period.

### Code along, then build it once more

Do the following when you get to the practical parts.

**First, write down what you need to do to create the component.** If you don't know how, that's okay. Use your best guess. When you write down your process, you can see the difference between how you think and how I think. That's how you learn to think like a developer.

**Second, code along with the tutorial.** Make sure you type every word manually. This helps you remember the functions and methods through muscle memory.

**Third, code the component yourself**. If you can complete the component without referring to the solution, summarize your learnings and start the next lesson. If you can't code it up yourself, figure out what you don't understand and try again.

### Take breaks

Although learning is fun, it can be tough. Sometimes, your brain just doesn't want to cooperate. You make silly mistakes and you blank out. Sometimes, you just don't want to learn anymore.

When this happens, its time to take a break.

When you take breaks, you brain organizes the information you learned, store it in the "right" place—whereever it is—for easy recall.

Remember, practicing 30mins a day gives more results than a four-hour day every week. If you feel that you need to rest after 15 mins today, give yourself a break and come back tomorrow. Consistency is the key to learning.

### Form accountability groups

It helps to have people study with you. Reach out to the community, introduce yourself and ask if anyone wants to study JavaScript together.

Better yet, share your experience—what you learned today, what you got stuck with, etc.—with the community. You'll motivate people, and people will motivate you back.

That's all the learning tips I have for you. Have fun learning JavaScript!
