# How to think like a developer

Do you stare at a JavaScript file, unsure how to begin, when you try to build things?

If you blank out, you're probably afraid of failing. You're so afraid that you'd rather wait for someone to give you answers than face the possibility of failing at creating something.

Many people who get stuck here calls this the **"coder's block"**. It's similar to "writer's block", where a writer doesn't know how what to write.

But the good news is, coder's block is a myth. You can overcome coder's block easily.

## Breaking out of coder's block

To break out of coder's block, you need to accept that failure is part and parcel of building thingsâ€”you'll get stuck, you'll write shitty code, and you may feel like you'll never be able to make that thing.

To get out of coder's block, put aside the fear of failure and focus on these four steps:

1. Break down the problem into small problems
2. Find solutions to your small problems
3. Assemble the solutions
4. Refactor and improve

### Step 1: Break down the problem into smaller problems

Answer this question: "How do you put an elephant into the fridge?"

Most people would say:

1. open the fridge
2. put the elephant in
3. close the fridge

Problem solved.

</figure>

This answer explains why many people get stuck when trying to codeâ€”**it skips steps**; lots of steps.

Many problems remain unanswered in the "model answer". If you think about it, you'll know what questions remain unanswered. Here are some examples of what I thought up:

1. What fridge are we talking about?
2. What kind of elephant are we talking about?
3. If the elephant is too huge to fit into the fridge, what do you do?
4. Where do you find the elephant in the first place?
5. How do you transport the elephant to your fridge?

"Putting the elephant in the fridge" is a huge problem, and huge problems are hard to tackle. "Build the thing" is an equally big problem too.

To tackle the huge problem, start by breaking down the problems into smaller problems, as what I have done for the elephant-in-fridge question.

Don't worry about the "correctness" or "size" of your small problems. Just break it down as much as you can for now. Write them all down.

### Step 2: Find solutions to your small problems

Pick one of your small problemsâ€”any one of themâ€”and start trying to solve them. Be as detailed as possible. If you can code, code.

For example:

1. What fridge? â€“ the fridge that sits in your kitchen
2. What kind of elephant? â€“ the [african bush elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_elephant)
3. What if the elephant is too big? â€“ Get a shrink gun (ðŸ”«) to shrink the elephant ðŸ˜Ž.
4. Where do you find the elephant? â€“ Africa
5. How do you transport the elephant? â€“ Put it in your bag after you've shrunk it, then take a plane back home.

At this point, you may realize that some problems remain too big to be solved. When this happens, you break that problem down into even smaller problems.

In the example above, answers #3 and #4 are still too vague. So, let's break it down further and get some answers.

1. Where do you get the shrink gun? â€“ Borrow from the mad scientist next door.
2. Where in Africa can you find the elephant? â€“ Addo Elephant Park in South Africa.

Once you have the answers to all your small problems, you've effectively solved the big problem. What's left is to piece them together so your solution works.

### Step 3: Assemble the solutions

In the put-elephant-in-fridge example, you can probably follow the following steps:

1. Get a shrink gun from the scientist next door
2. Fly to South Africa
3. Travel to Addo Elephant Park
4. Find an elephant in the park
5. Shoot the elephant with the shrink gun
6. Put the shrunk elephant in your bag
7. Travel back to the airport
8. Fly back to your country
9. Travel to your house
10. Put the elephant in your fridge

Problem solved. Sounds logical, yeah? (But as interesting as the elephant example sounds, you probably won't be flying to Africa to capture elephants anytime soon).

It's important to get practice breaking down big problems and then solving small problems; you'll naturally come to an answer when you solve all your small problems. It might not be the best solution, but at least it works!

Once you get a solution that works, it might be time to improve the solution. If you want to improve your solution, proceed to step 4.

### Step 4. Refactor and improve

When you piece your solution together, you'll probably end up with spaghetti code; it's messy, ugly, and goes all over the place.

If you can spare some time, you might want to refactor your solution, improve it so the code doesn't feel so messy. Along the way, you'll learn how to write clean code.

If you don't know how to tidy your code, you can start by combining common things you use into functionsâ€”so you don't repeat yourself. Then, you see if there are any improvements you can make.

Most of the time, you won't be able to see improvements, because you've just completed the solution for the first time. It's okay; don't beat yourself up if you feel your code is messy. If it works, you've scored a victory. Celebrate your achievement!

After celebrating, work on a new problem. Do this a few more times and you may begin to notice small improvements you can make. You may also notice improvements if you read other people's code.

If you notice any improvements, find time to work on the old thing that you've built. Build it again with the knowledge you have nowâ€”it'll get better, and you'll consolidate what you learned.

## Wrapping up

Don't worry about the quality of the code. If you don't mind writing shitty code, you won't have problems with your blank screen. Everyone starts somewhere. I started by writing shit too.

Break down your problems, find solutions and assemble them. That's the nature of code. It either works or it doesn't. Once it works, it works.

Don't worry about improving your code now. Come back in a week, two weeks or a month, after you've built a few more things; you'll magically see what you need to do. If it helps, you'll learn to refactor code with JavaScript best practices in a later module :)

Now, time to get your hands and brain dirty!
