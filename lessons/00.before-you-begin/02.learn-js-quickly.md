Straight forward tips.

1. Slow down.
2. Plan a dedicated time to learn JavaScript everyday.
3. Doesn't matter how much you learn. As long as you keep at it.
4. Make sure you understand lesson before moving on. If not' ask. Don't move on until you have a clear picture. You know ah, I got it.
5. If you feel the reluctance to learn coming up, let yourself go. Come back and learn again tomorrow.
6. How to learn/remember = pay attention. Beleieve, or at least, suspend disbelief.
7. Don't worry about being fast/slow.

Then, link to lessons maybe? Depends on tone of voice. Maybe explain it all here better.
