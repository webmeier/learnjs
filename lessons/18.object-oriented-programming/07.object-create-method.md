# Objects instead of Constructors and Classes

There's a third way of creating and inheriting objects with JavaScript. This third way will probably be the most intuitive way for you as JavaScript developers, but this way is not very well known.

The third way is to create objects through Objects and `Object.create`. Kyle Simpsons calls this method "OLOO" (Object linking to other objects); I prefer to call it the `Object.create` method.

## Creating instances with `Object.create`

Let's say you want to create humans with a `firstName`, a `lastName`, and the ability to say their names. If you use the `Object.create` method, you'll create an object named `Human` as the constructing object.

```js
const Human = {
  init (firstName, lastName, age) {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
  },
  sayName () {
    console.log(`I am ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`)
  }
}
```

To create an instance of the Human object, you call `Object.create`:

```js
const humanInstance = Object.create(Human)
```

If you `console.log(humanInstance)`, you'll see `init` and `sayName` methods in the instance's prototype.

To create instances with their individuality, you need to run the `init` method.

```js
const vincy = Object.create(Human)
vincy.init('Vincy', 'Zhang')

vincy.sayName() // I am Vincy Zhang
```

## Inheritance through `Object.create`

Let's say you want to create a Developer who knows how to code now. This `Developer` object should inherit from `Human`, since developers are humans too.

To inherit an object, you can use `Object.create`. (This is the same code as creating an instance).

```js
const Developer = Object.create(Human)
```

Since developers should know how to code, we can add a `code` method to all the Developer object.

```js
const Developer = Object.create(Human)

// Adding a code method to the Developer object
Developer.code = function(thing) {
  console.log(`Coded a ${thing}!`)
}
```

If you `console.log(Developer)` now, you should see the `code` method directly in `Developer`. You should also see `init` and `sayName` methods in `Developer`'s prototype.

To create a developer instance, you use `Object.create` again.

```js
const zell = Object.create(Developer)
zell.init('Zell', 'Liew')

zell.sayName() // I am Zell Liew
zell.code('website') // Coded a website!
```

If you `console.log(zell)` at this point, you'll see that all methods—`code`, `init` and `sayName`—live on the `[[Prototype]]`.

## Initializing children instances differently from parent instances

Let's say all developers have a job title called `Developer`. When you create developers, you probably don't want to manually add their job titles:

```js
// This is repetitive and not ideal
const zell = Object.create(Developer)
zell.init('Zell', 'Liew')
zell.jobTitle = 'Developer'

const jing = Object.create(Developer)
jing.init('Hui Jing', 'Chen')
jing.jobTitle = 'Developer'
```

If you want to make it less painful, you can change `Developer`'s `init` function to add job titles to your instances. If you edit `Developer`'s init function, make sure to call `Human`'s init function too.

```js
Developer.init = function (firstName, lastName) {
  Human.init(firstName, lastName)
  this.jobTitle = 'Developer'
}
```

```js
const zell = Object.create(Developer)
zell.init('Zell', 'Liew')

const jing = Object.create(Developer)
jing.init('Hui Jing', 'Chen')

console.log(zell.jobTitle) // Developer
console.log(jing.jobTitle) // Developer
```

That's it!

Note: alternatively, you can create a `jobTitle` property for each developer after you've created a `Developer` instance. You don't need to change the `init` method. (I just wanted to show you how to change it).

## A quick tip

It can get tiring to add multiple methods to a child instance. If you want to speed things up, you can use `Object.assign` to mutate the child instance; this method allows you to write object literals too.

```js
// Before
const Developer = Object.create(Human)

Developer.jobTitle = 'Developer'

Developer.code = function(thing) {
  console.log(`Coded a ${thing}!`)
}

Developer.prototype = function(thing) {
  console.log('Made a quickt prototype!')
}

```

```js
// After
const Developer = Object.create(Human)

Object.assign(Developer, {
  jobTitle: 'Developer',
  code (thing) {
    console.log(`Coded a ${thing}!`)
  },
  prototype (thing) {
    console.log('Made a quickt prototype!')
  }
})
```

## OLOO, Constructors or Classes?

There's no "best" way to create instances. All three methods—OLOO, Constructors and Classes—work well. Your decision to use one method over another largely hinges on personal/team preferences.

There are subtle pros and cons between each method though. For example, the OLOO method creates objects at a slightly slower rate (but it doesn't matter unless you're creating millions of objects at once).

## Wrapping up

There's a third way to create instances, and that's through `Object.create`. You can use OLOO, Constructors or Classes for Object Oriented Programming; there's no best method. Your decision largely hinges on personal/team preferences.

## Exercise

Learn to write OLOO:

1. Create a constructing object.
2. Create an instance with `Object.create`.
3. Create a child object (like `Developer`) with `Object.create`.
4. Add properties and methods to your child object.
5. Create an instance of the child object.
6. `console.log` both parent and child instances. Pay attention to the `[[Prototype]]` chain.
