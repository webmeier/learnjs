# This in Javascript

`this` is a keyword that's used a lot in Object Oriented Programming. In traditional Object Oriented Programming languages, `this` points to the object.

But in Javascript, the value of `this` changes depending on how you call a function, so `this` can be quite confusing for beginners. It can take up to four different values:

1. The object
2. `window`
3. The `this` value in its immediate context.
4. The listening element.

## this === object

There are two cases where `this` points to the object.

**The first case is when `this` is used in a constructor.** You already learned about this from the previous lesson.

```js
function Cup (color) {
  this.color = color
  console.log(this)
}

const redCup = new Cup('red')
```

</figure>

**The second case where `this` points to the object is when `this` is used directly in a method.**


```js
const Cup = {
  color: 'red',
  sayThis () {
    console.log(this)
  }
}

Cup.sayThis()
```

  <img src="../../images/oop/this/this-in-method.png" alt="Image showing that `this` in a method points to the object itself">
  <figcaption aria-hidden="true">This in a method points to the object</figcaption>
</figure>

## this === window

There are two cases where `this` points to the `window`.

**The first case is when you try to get `this` in a global context.**

Try to `console.log(this)` directly in your Javascript file and you'll see `window`.

```js
console.log(this)
```

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/oop/this/this-in-global.png" alt="Image showing that `this` points to window when you console.log it directly">
  <figcaption aria-hidden="true">This points to window when you console.log it directly</figcaption>
</figure>

Note: If you're using the advanced starter template, you'll see `undefined` instead of `window`, because Webpack doesn't allow you to access the global context. You'll understand in a later lesson.

**The second case where `this` points to `window` is within a simple function**

```js
function sayThis () { console.log(this) }
sayThis()
```

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/oop/this/this-in-simple.png" alt="Image showing that `this` points to window in a simple function">
  <figcaption>this in a simple function points to window as well</figcaption>
</figure>

One frustrating thing for beginners to understand is this â€“ `this` always point to `window`, even when if the simple function is used in a method.

```js
const Cup = {
  sayThis () {
    const saySimpleThis = function () { console.log('simple', this) }
    saySimpleThis()
    console.log('method', this)
  }
}

Cup.sayThis()
```

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/oop/this/this-in-simple-method.png" alt="Image showing that `this` in a simple function always point to window, even if its in a method.">
  <figcaption aria-hidden="true">this in a simple function always point to window, even if its in a method.</figcaption>
</figure>

## this === the current context

`this` in an arrow function always points to the same `this` value in the surrounding scope.

In the example below, the `this` value within `arrowSayThis` is the same value as `this` in `sayThis`. Since the `this` value in `sayThis` is the cup, `this` within the arrow function also points back to the cup.

```js
const Cup = {
  sayThis () {
    const arrowSayThis = _ => console.log(this)
    arrowSayThis()
  }
}

Cup.sayThis()
```

  <figcaption>When arrow functions are used to create functions in methods, this will point back to the object. </figcaption>
</figure>

If you use the arrow function to create simple functions in a global context, `this` points to `window` because `window` is the `this` value of the surrounding scope.

```js
const sayThis = _ => console.log(this)
sayThis()
```

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/oop/this/this-in-arrow2.png" alt="Image showing that `this` in an arrow function points to the `window` when it is used to declare functions directly">
  <figcaption>When arrow functions are used directly, this points back to window. </figcaption>
</figure>

## this === the listening element

`this` points to the listening element in an event listener.

```js
const button = document.querySelector('button')

button.addEventListener('click', function() {
  console.log(this) // button
})
```

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/oop/this/this-in-event-listener1.png" alt="Image showing that a console.log of `this` in an event listener. The log shows button.">
  <figcaption>When this is used in an event listener, this points back to the button</figcaption>
</figure>

Remember, if you write event listeners with arrow functions, you can still get the listening element with `event.currentTarget`, even though `this` points to something else.

```js
const button = document.querySelector('button')

button.addEventListener('click', e => {
  console.log(this) // Window
  console.log(e.currentTarget) // button
})
```

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/oop/this/this-in-event-listener2.png" alt="Image showing that a console.log of `this` and `e.currentTarget`. This shows Window, while `e.currentTarget` shows button.">
  <figcaption>event.currentTarget can still be used to get the listening element when this points to something else. </figcaption>
</figure>

## Wrapping up

`this` can take up four different values, depending on how you call a function.

1. `this` in constructor functions and `this` directly in a method point to the object itself.
2. `this` in a global context and `this` in a simple function point to `Window`.
3. `this` in an arrow function always takes up the value of `this` in its surrounding scope.
4. `this` in an event listener points to the listening element.

## Exercise

What's the value of `this` in each of the following pieces of code?

```js
function sayMyName (firstName, lastName) {
  // 1. What's the value of this here?
  console.log(`${firstName} ${lastName}`)
}

sayMyName()
```

```js
const Crab = function (name) {
  // 2. What's the value of `this` here in the following two cases
  this.name = name
}
const crab1 = Crab(Sebastian) // Case 1
const crab2 = new Crab(Sebastian) // Case 2
```

```js
const mermaid = (name) => {
  this.hasScales = true
  this.hasTail: true

  this.sing = function (song) {
    this.currentSong = song
    // 3. What's the value of `this` here?
    console.log(song)
  }

  this.encore = function () {
    const song = this.previousSong
    setTimeout((song) => {
      // 4. What's the value of `this` here?
      console.log(song)
    }, 1000);
  }
}

const ariel = mermaid('Ariel')
```

Write down your thoughts about `this`. Try to consolidate it in pen/paper format so you remember the knowledge for a longer time.
