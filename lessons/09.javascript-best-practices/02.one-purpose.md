# Functions should have one purpose

When functions have one purpose, they're easier to read. You can tell at a glance what's going to happen. For example, if you see `filter`, you know you'll get a filtered array.

Here's another exampleâ€”`multiply`. When you see `multiply`, you immediately know it's going to return the multiple of two numbers

```js
const multiply = (n1, n2) => n1 * n2
```

## Functions names should begin with verbs

Verbs are action words. If your function name begins with a verb, you'll know what the function does.

Here are a few examples:

- `countApples` counts the number of apples
- `createUser` creates a user for the app
- `nextSlide` selects the next slide
- `sayName` says the name of the user
- `filter` returns a filtered array

Pretty straightforward, isn't it?
