# ðŸ›  Refactoring the tabbed component

We can do the same things as the accordion here:

1. Extract the event handler as a separate function
2. Avoid global variables

You should be able to do this on your own. Check out the completed code at `./component/tabbed-component/04-refactored.md` if you need help.
