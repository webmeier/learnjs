# ðŸ›  Refactoring the tabbed component

We can use two best practice to refactor the tabbed component. They are:

1. Write declarative code
2. Write functions with a single purpose
3. Manage scope

## Writing declarative code

Take a look at the code for the event listener. It looks like this now.

```js
tabList.addEventListener('click', e => {
  const link = e.target.closest('a')
  const tab = link.parentNode
  const href = link.getAttribute('href')
  const tabContent = component.querySelector(href)

  // Hiding previous tab and tab content
  tabs.forEach(elem => elem.classList.remove('is-selected'))
  contents.forEach(elem => elem.classList.remove('is-selected'))

  // Showing the selected tab and tab content
  tab.classList.add('is-selected')
  tabContent.classList.add('is-selected')
})
```

What does it do?

There are too many implementation details. The code is difficult to understand if you look at it without context.

The first thing we can do for the refactor is put the event listener code into a dedicated function.

When you click on a tab, you want to toggle between tabs. Let's call this function `toggleTabs`.

```js
const toggleTabs = e => {
  const link = e.target.closest('a')
  const tab = link.parentNode
  const href = link.getAttribute('href')
  const tabContent = component.querySelector(href)

  // Hiding previous tab and tab content
  tabs.forEach(elem => elem.classList.remove('is-selected'))
  contents.forEach(elem => elem.classList.remove('is-selected'))

  // Showing the selected tab and tab content
  tab.classList.add('is-selected')
  tabContent.classList.add('is-selected')
}

tabList.addEventListener('click', toggleTabs)
```

## Managing scope

We have a few problems with `toggleTabs`. If you look at the code, can you identify these variables?

1. `component`
2. `tabs`
3. `contents`

You can't, because these variables are defined outside of `toggleTabs`. We want to bring these variables into `toggleTabs` so we know what they are.

### Getting `component`

First, we declared `component` in the first line. This variable is used to look for `tabList`, and `tabList` is the component we're listening on.

This means `component` should not be declared in `toggleTabs`. If we declare `component` again in toggleTabs, we are declaring it for the second time.

The easiest way to get `component` into `toggleTabs` is to pass it as a variable.

```js
const toggleTabs = (e, component) => {
  // ...
}

tabList.addEventListener('click', e => toggleTabs(e, component))
```

### Getting `tabs`

Next, we need to create a variable for `tabs`. `tabs` contains elements with the `.tab` class. We can get the same selection from `.tab`.

```js
const toggleTabs = (e, component) => {
  const tabs = [...tab.parentElement.children]
}
```

`tab` and `tabs` are very similar. It is easy to get ourselves confused between these two. To make it easier for us to differentiate what `tab` and `tabs` are, we can rename `tab` to `selectedTab`.

```js
const toggleTabs = (e, component) => {
  // ...
  const selectedTab = link.parentNode
  const tabs = [...selectedTab.parentElement.children]

  // ...
  selectedTab.classList.add('is-selected')
}
```

Likewise, we should also rename `tabContent` to `selectedTabContent`.

```js
const toggleTabs = (e, component) => {
  // ...
  const selectedTabContent = component.querySelector(href)

  // ...
  selectedTabContent.classList.add('is-selected')
}
```

### Getting `contents`

`contents` contains all elements with the class of `.tab-content`. We can get `contents` by performing a `querySelectorAll` search within `component`.

Let's also change the variable `contents` into `tabContents` since its more specific.

```js
const toggleTabs = (e, component) => {
  // ...
  const tabContents = [...component.querySelectorAll('.tab-content')]

  // ...
  tabContents.forEach(elem => elem.classList.remove('is-selected'))
}
```
