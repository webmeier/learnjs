# Preventing Arrays from mutating

To prevent arrays from mutating, you need to copy your arrays before you work on them. You can do so with `slice` and `concat`. You already learned about them in the for loops module.

You can also use the array methods you learned in "Useful array methods". These methods return mutate the original array too.

## Array.slice

When you use `Array.slice`, you tell JavaScript which parts of the array you want to **copy** out as your new array.

```js
const newArray = array.slice(startIndex, endIndex)
```

If you omit the `startIndex` and `endIndex` values, you'll get a copy of your array.

```js
const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const arrayCopy = originalArray.slice()
```

When you mutate the copied array, the original array remains the same.

```js
arrayCopy[5] = 6
console.log(originalArray) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(arrayCopy) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

## Array.concat

`Array.concat` lets you combine two arrays together. When you use `Array.concat`, you create a new array immediately, so no mutation occurs.

```js
const firstArray = [1, 2, 3]
const secondArray = [4, 5, 6]
const newArray = firstArray.concat(secondArray)

console.log(firstArray) // [1, 2, 3]
console.log(newArray) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

Remember, you can alway use the spread operator to make `concat` easier.

## Don't use pop, push, shift, unshift and splice

Most JavaScript resources teach you `pop`, `push`, `shift`, `unshift`, and `splice` because they're deem "easier" to learn. However, these methods mutate your arrays, which is why you shouldn't use them.

Once in a while, `pop` can be useful. To use it, make sure you use `slice` create a copy of the original array first. This way, you don't mutate the original array.

```js
const originalArray = [1, 2, 3]
const copy = originalArray.slice()

copy.pop()
console.log(copy) // [1, 2]
console.log(originalArray) // [1, 2, 3]
```
