# Don't reassign

If you need to create a variable that can be changed to something else, you an use the `let` keyword.

```js
let toy = 'I need to change into something else later!'
```

This variable is often changed later in a control flow (a control flow tells code how to behave given a certain condition. Examples of control flows include `if/else` statements and `for` loops) with a reassignment.

```js
if (newborn.gender === 'girl') {
  toy = 'doll'
} else {
  toy = 'car'
}
```

But there are two problems with reassignments:

1. You may accidentally reassign a value into the external state
2. Code that reassigns consume more brainpower than code that don't reassign.

## Accidentally reassigning a value into the external state

When you reassign variables, you use this syntax:

```js
variable = 'new value'
```

It doesn't matter whether you reassign a locally scoped variable or a variable from the outside scope. Both work the same way.

```js
let outside = `I'm outside`

function aTypicalFunction() {
  let inside = 'before reassigning'

  // Reassignment in progress
  outside = `I have been reassigned`
  inside = `I have been reassigned too`
}

aTypicalFunction()
```

If you reassign an external variable, you change the state of the program. We already discussed why you should not change the state of programs earlier in [pure functions](07.pure-functions.md).

```js
aTypicalFunction()
console.log(outside) // I have been reassigned
```

Better to avoid reassignments whenever you can, unless you need them.

## Code that reassigns consume more brainpower

When you use `let` to create a variable, you tell your brain "hey, this variable is going to change, so keep track of it".

Then, when you change your variable in a control flow, you brain needs to update the variable in your head. This process gets harder if you change your variables multiple times in different control flows.

```js
let toy = ''

if (newborn.gender === 'girl') {
  toy = 'doll'
} else {
  toy = 'car'
}

giveToy(toy)
```

Compare the code above with what I'm going to show you next. Which one feels easier to read?

```js
const toy = newborn === 'girl' ? 'doll' : 'car'
giveToy(toy)
```

The second one, isn't it? You no longer have to worry about `toy` changing values when you use `const`; you'll automatically allocated brainpower to something else.

Now, let's talk about the weird `?` and `:` syntax. It's called a ternary operator.

## Use const over let

Train yourself to avoid reassignments. Use `const` over `let` to declare variables as much as you can. Whenever you see a variable with `let`, refactor your code so it uses `const`.

## Exercise

Go through the exercises you've done in previous lessons. On what occasions did you use `let` and reassignments? Refactor these occasions to use `const`.
