# Id, classes, tags and attributes

You can select Elements with id, classes, tags or even attributes. What one you use largely boils down to personal preference.

## What I use

**I prefer selecting Elements with classes as much as possible**. I would add a `js` prefix to the Element so I know it contains some JavaScript functionality when I view its HTML.

```html
<!-- An example of how I'd use a js prefix -->
<div class="component jsComponent">...</div>
```

Then, in my JavaScript file, I'd select the component with `querySelector`:

```js
const component = querySelector('.jsComponent')
// Do something
```

**I prefer classes over id** because you can include multiple components with the same class name on one HTML page. With id, you can only have one instance of the same id.

Hence, when I need to include an additional component, I can simply duplicate the original component in the HTML and switch `querySelector` to `querySelectorAll` in the JavaScript.

```html
<div class="component jsComponent">...</div>
<div class="component jsComponent">...</div>
```

```js
const components = querySelectorAll('.jsComponent')
components.forEach(component => /* do something */)
```

**I prefer classes over tags** because tags are less specific compared to classes. There's a higher chance of complication when selecting with tags.

For instance, you make your code more complicated if the select your component with the `<div>` tag if you have the following HTML:

```html
<div>...</div>
<div class="component jsComponent">...</div>
```
