# Default arguments

When you create functions, sometimes you don't need your users to provide every argument. Some arguments can be inferred if they're not provided.

When?

Let's say you have a `addPlayerToTeam` function that adds a new player into a team of your choice. To add a player, you need to provide two argumentsâ€”the name of the player, and the player's position.

```js
const addPlayerToTeam = (players, name, position) => {
  return players.concat({
    name,
    position
  })
}
```

Unless otherwise stated, new players are automatically placed on reserve. If you didn't provide a specific position for the new player, the code should automatically put the player on the reserve position.

To do that, you can create a variable and test if the position variable exists. If it does not exist, replace it with 'reserve'.

```js
const addPlayerToTeam = (players, name, position) => {
  const pos = position || 'reserve'

  return players.concat({
    name,
    position: pos
  })
}
```

```js
const team = addPlayerToTeam([], 'Zell')

console.log(team)
// [{
//   name: 'Zell',
//   position: 'reserve'
// }]
```

In ES6, you can provide default arguments easily by adding `=` when declaring arguments, like this:

```js
const addPlayerToTeam = (players, name, position = 'reserve') => {
  return players.concat({
    name,
    position
  })
}
```

```js
const team = addPlayerToTeam([], 'Zell')

console.log(team)
// [{
//   name: 'Zell',
//   position: 'reserve'
// }]
```

## Optional destructured arguments

Let's say you need more fields for `addPlayerToTeam`. In addition to `name` and `position`, you need to know the player's age, last name, country, and phone number.

One way to create this function is to create multiple variables, like so:

```js
function addPlayerToTeam (players, firstName, lastName, country, age, position) {
  // ...
}

// Adding a team member
addPlayerToTeam([], 'Zell', 'Liew', 'Singapore', 30, 'reserve')
```

That's a lot of stuff! You'll probably forget what variable stands for what as you write. So, the easier way is to pass in an object as an argument.

```js
function addPlayerToTeam(players, details) {
  return players.concat({
    firstName: details.firstName,
    lastName: details.lastName,
    country: details.country,
    age: details.age,
    position: details.position || 'reserve'
  })
}
```

In ES6, you can use destructure objects and provide default arguments at the same time. To do so, make sure the object is an optional argument first.

This way, when you pass in nothing, nothing will get registered.

```js
function addPlayerToTeam(players, details = {}) {
  return players.concat({
    firstName: details.firstName,
    lastName: details.lastName,
    country: details.country,
    age: details.age,
    position: details.position || 'reserve'
  })
}
```

```
add player thing
```

Then, destructure the optional argument and provide fallback values as you destructure.

```js
function addPlayerToTeam(players, {
  firstName,
  lastName,
  country
  age,
  position = reserve
} = {}) {
  return players.concat({
    firstName,
    lastName,
    country,
    age,
    position
  })
}
```

```
```
