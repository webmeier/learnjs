# Chain arrays

When your array returns another array, you can immediately run another array method.

For example, let's say you have a list of numbers.

```js
const numbers = [10, 5, 3, 4, 20, 25]
```

You want to:

1. Filter to a list with numbers smaller than 5
2. Multiply every number in the list by 20
3. Get the sum of the multiplied list

Here's how I would do it:

## Filtering to a list with numbers smaller than 5

To get a list of numbers smaller than 5, you can use the `filter` method.

```js
const numbers = [10, 5, 3, 4, 20, 25]
const filtered = numbers.filter(n => n < 5)

console.log(filtered) // [3, 4]
```

## Multiply every number in the filtered list by 20

To multiple every number in the filtered list by 20, you can use `map`.

```js
const multiplied = filtered.map(n => n * 20)

console.log(multiplied) // [60, 80]
```

## Summing numbers up

To sum numbers up, you can use `reduce`.

```js
const sum = multiplied.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0)

console.log(sum) // 140
```

## Chaining them together

If you noticed, `filter` returns an array. Since the returned value is an array, you can call array methods immediately.

```js
const multiplied =
  numbers.filter(n => n < 5)
    .map(n => n * 20)

console.log(multiplied) // [60, 80]
```

Since `map` returns another array, you can call `reduce` immediately too.

```js
const result =
  numbers.filter(n => n < 5)
      .map(n => n * 20)
      .reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0)

console.log(result) // 140
```

## Exercise

Practice chaining with the following set of code:

```js
const people = [{
  firstName: 'Zell',
  age: 30
}, {
  firstName: 'Vincy',
  age: 49
}, {
  firstName: 'Thomas',
  age: 70
}, {
  firstName: 'Karen',
  age: 27
}, {
  firstName: 'Matthew',
  age: 66
}]
```

Exercise 1:

1. Get a list of people below 50 years old
2. Find Karen from this list.

Exercise 2:

1. Get a list of people older than 50
2. Make an `<li>` element for each person you find in the list.
3. Join the `<li>` elements together (see [Adding multiple HTML elements](../07.text-and-content/03.adding-multiple-elements.md) for hints)
