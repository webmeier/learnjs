# Destructure objects and functions arguments

Normally, when you want to get a value out of an array or object, you have to declare the variables and assign them individually:

```js
// Getting values from arrays
const numbers = [22, 99, 100]
const firstNumber = numbers[0]
const secondNumber = numbers[1]
```

```js
// Getting values from objects
const person = {
  firstName: 'Zell'
  lastName: 'Liew'
}

const firstName = person.firstName
const lastName = person.lastName
```

In ES6, you can **destructure** variables, a process where you declare and assign multiple variables with a single line of code.

```js
// Destructuring arrays
const [firstNumber, secondNumber] = numbers
```

```js
// Destructuring objects
const {firstName, lastName} = person
```

Destructured arrays and objects behave differently. Let's dive into each of them to understand their nuances.

## Destructuring arrays

To destructure an array, you write the names of the variables you'd like to declare within square brackets (`[]`).

```js
const numbers = [22, 99, 100]
const [firstNumber, secondNumber] = numbers
```

The first destructured variable will always be the first item in the array, the second destructured variable will always be the second item, and so on...

```js
console.log(firstNumber) // 22
console.log(secondNumber) // 99
```

If there are not enough items in the array, the destructured variable will remain `undefined`.

```js
const numbers = [22]
const [firstNumber, secondNumber] = numbers

console.log(secondNumber) // undefined
```

## Destructuring objects

To destructure an object, you write the names of the properties you'd like to declare as variables in curly braces (`{}`).

```js
const person = {
  firstName: 'Zell',
  lastName: 'Liew'
}

const { firstName, lastName } = person
```

Here, JavaScript assigns `person.firstName` to the `firstName` variable and `person.lastName` to the `lastName` variable.

```js
console.log(firstName) // Zell
console.log(lastName) // Liew
```

If you try to destructure a non-existent property, you'll get `undefined`.

```js
const course = { name: 'Learn JavaScript' }
const { description } = course

console.log(description) // undefined
```

### Using a different variable name for destructured variables.

When you destructure, you're declaring variables at the same time. This means you still need to follow the rules for creating variables. For instance, you can't have two variables with the same name.

```js
const name = 'Zell Liew'
const course = {name: 'Learn JavaScript'}

const { name } = course // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared
```

You can change the name of your destructured variable with colon (`:`).

```js
const { name: courseName } = course
console.log(courseName) // Learn JavaScript
```

## Destructuring function arguments

You can also destructure function arguments if the argument is an array or an object.

```js
const scores = [100, 99, 98]
const firstThree = ([first, second, third]) => {
  return {
    first: first
    second: second
    third: third
  }
}

console.log(firstThree(scores))
// {
//   first: 100,
//   second: 99,
//   third: 98
// }
```

## Default parameters when destructuring

You can provide fallback values for destructured variables with `=`.

```js
// Fallback value for destructured array
const emojis = ['ðŸ¤¢']
const [firstEmoji, secondEmoji = 'ðŸ˜Ž'] = emojis

console.log(secondEmoji) // ðŸ˜Ž
```

```js
// Fallback value for destructured object
const course = { name: 'Learn JavaScript' }
const { description = `Best JavaScript course ever!` } = course

console.log(description) // Best JavaScript course ever!
```

You can even rename variables while providing fallback values. To do so, you use both `:` and `=`. The syntax is wonky and hard to read though; I high discourage you from doing this. If you ever need it, refactor your code instead.

```js
const course = { name: 'Learn JavaScript' }
const { courseDescription: description = `Best JavaScript course ever!` } = course

console.log(description) // Best JavaScript course ever!
```

## Wrapping up

Destructuring gives you a way to extract values out from objects and arrays quickly.

To destructure an array, you use `[]`. The first destructured variable is always the first item in the array, the second destructured variable is the second item in the array, and so on.

To destructure an object, you use `{}`. The destructured variable should be the property name of the object. Optionally, you can rename destructured variables if you wish to.

You can also provide default values to a destructured variable if it doesn't exist.

## Exercise

Perform these actions with the following set of data:

1. Get the first two items in `posts` with destructuring.
2. Get the `id` and `title` of the first post with destructuring.
3. Rename the `title` of the first post to `content` while you destructure.
4. Create a `description` variable and provide it with a default value `Nothing is better than leaving the description empty`.

```js
const posts = [{
  id: 800,
  title: 'This is ðŸ’©'
}, {
  id: 801,
  title: 'Pooing is a natural thing.'
}, {
  id: 802,
  title: 'Poo jokes are getting irritating'
}]
```
