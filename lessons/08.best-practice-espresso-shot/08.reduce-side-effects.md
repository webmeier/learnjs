# Reduce side effects

When a function modifies the state of a program, it is said to introduce **side effects**. By that definition, all impure functions (functions that are not pure) introduce side effects.

```js
let num = 25
addAnotherTen()

// `addAnotherTen` introduced a side effect
console.log(num) // 35
```

## Side effects aren't always bad

Side effects may sound bad, but they're not always bad. Every program needs side effects to function. You've already written a few side effects without noticing.

Here are a few examples:

1. Changing the class of a HTML element
2. Changing the attribute of a HTML element
3. Changing the textContent of a HTML element
4. Adding or removing elements from the DOM

## Group side effects together

Bugs introduced by side effects can be hard to catch. This is because state changes are valid JavaScript changes; they produce no error messages.

You have already seen why when you went through [prevent mutation](02.prevent-mutations.md). If you mutate an object, another object elsewhere can change without you noticing, and this can cause your program to behave unexpectedly.

```js
const egg = { name: "Humpty Dumpty" };
const newEgg = egg;
newEgg.name = "Errr ... Not Humpty Dumpty";

console.log(egg);
// {
//   name: "Errr ... Not Humpty Dumpty"
// }
```

To give yourself an easier time, you should group side effects together.
