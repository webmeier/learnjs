# Building the carousel with JavaScript

There are a few things in the carousel that we don't need when there is no JavaScript. So, we can build them with JavaScript. Examples include:

1. The previous button
2. The next button
3. The dots

If there's no JavaScript, this component shouldn't work. Now, becareful that progressive enhancement isn't just thinking about whether users have JavaScript or not. But this is something necessary tot hink about.

To JavaSCript or not to JavaScript? How important is this component to work without JavaScript? If it isn't mission critical, you might be able to create it with JavaScript directly, because, because, well' you know. Everything requires JavaScript nowadays...

Performance issue? I don't think there's too much performance issues here. The only problem is: if the carousel needs to be styled BEFORE the thing gets shown... ah that's where the problem lie. I still need to talk about that..

But before I get there, there's no good excuse why we should create this component first. So I'm not going to dive into it yet. I'll talk about it in the progressive enhancement suciton. Yeah, I know, not very good because I'm changing the order again, but well, what can I say?
