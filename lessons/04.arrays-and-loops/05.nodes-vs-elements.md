# Nodes vs Elements

If this is the first time you've heard of Nodes, you'll likely be confused. What's the difference between Elements and Nodes?

## Node

If you visualize the DOM as a tree diagram, the DOM represents the entire diagram, while each stem and leaf represents a Node.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/dom-basics/node-vs-elem/dom.png" alt="Visual representation of a DOM tree">
  <figcaption>Visual representation of a DOM tree</figcaption>
</figure>

In this image above, you can see multiple Nodes.

- The `<html>` Element is a Node.
- The `<body>` Element is a Node.
- The `<h1>` Element is a Node.
- The `A heading` text is a Node.
- The `<a>` Element is a Node.
- The `Link text` text is a Node.

There are two types of Nodes in the example above: **Element** and **Text**. Below, you'll see a complete list of all available Nodes. A few of them are deprecated (which means they are obsolete, and you should avoid them)

- Element node
- Text node
- Processing instruction node
- Comment node
- Document node
- Document type node
- Document fragment node
- Attribute node (deprecated)
- CDATA section node (deprecated)
- Entity reference node (deprecated)
- Entity node (deprecated)
- Notation node (deprecated)

Nodes have a [set of properties and methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Node) you can use. Most of them aren't used, except for these two:

1. `Node.parentElement` â€“ Returns an Element that is the parent of this node. If the node has no parent, or if that parent is not an Element, this property returns null.
2. `Node.textContent` - Returns / Sets the textual content of an element and all its descendants.

Should you care about Nodes? Don't worry about them.

Let's move on to Elements.

## Elements

An Element is a specific type of Node. Since they an Element is a Node, they have all the properties and methods that Nodes have.

They also have another set of [properties and methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element) that you'll often use. We'll go through the important methods and properties in the DOM Deep dive module.

## Exercise

Nothing to do this lesson. Key takeaway is to make sure you know the difference between Elements and Nodes and not get confused between them.
