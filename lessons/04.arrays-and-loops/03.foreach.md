# Array.forEach

All arrays contain a `forEach` method. It does exactly the same thing a `for` loop does, but allows you to write single-line code. I highly recommend learning it.

## The forEach syntax

The `forEach` method takes in a callback. This callback gives you three arguments:

```js
array.forEach((currentValue, index, array) => {
  // Your loop here
})
```

- `currentValue` refers to the current item in the array.
- `index` is the position of the item within the array. The first item has an index of 0; the second, an index of 1; and so on.
- `array` refers to the array that you're looping over. You don't need this argument most of the time.

When you're looping over arrays, you're mostly concerned only with the `currentValue`. You can safely omit the other arguments if you don't need them. So, the `forEach` loop often looks like this:

```js
array.forEach(currentValue => {
  // Your statement here
})
```

## An example

Let's say you have a fruit basket that contains the following fruits. You can use the `forEach` method to loop over each item. Here's how the `forEach` method looks in comparison to `for` loops.

```js
const fruitBasket = ['banana', 'pear', 'guava']

// The forEach loop
fruitBasket.forEach(fruit => {
  console.log(fruit)
})

// For...of loop
for (let fruit of fruitBasket) {
  console.log(fruit)
}

// For loop
for (let i = 0; i < fruitsBasket.length - 1; i++) {
  console.log(fruitBasket[i])
}
```

As you can see, there's not much of a difference between `for...of` and `forEach`. Both are much easier to use compared to a `for` loop.

However, with arrow functions, you can reduce a `forEach` statement to a one-liner. This makes it easier to read and shorter to write.

```js
fruitBasket.forEach(fruit => console.log(fruit))
```

## For...of vs forEach

You can use either `for...of` or `forEach` to loop through all arrays. They do the same thing.

I prefer `forEach` because it's easier to read, shorter to write, which means it's more maintainable and has less room for bugs to hide.

Furthermore, `forEach` is a good base to help you learn more advanced array methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `find`, `some` and `every`. Each method mentioned does a specific thing that's way more useful that `forEach` or even `for...of`.

You will only use `for...of` over `forEach` if you need the [increased speed performance](https://jsperf.com/for-vs-foreach/66). Most of the time, the speed improvements is negligible.

## Exercise

Practice using `forEach` through an array of people (given below). Do the following:

1. `console.log` the first name of each person in the array.
2. Make a second array that contains only the first name of each person.
3. Make a third array that contains people that have died after 1950.
4. Find index of Charles Darwin in the array.

Here's the list of people to use for this exercise:

```js
const people = [
  { firstName: 'Benjamin', lastName: 'Franklin', yearOfDeath: 1790 },
  { firstName: 'Thomas', lastName: 'Edison', yearOfDeath: 1931 },
  { firstName: 'Franklin', lastName: 'Roosevelt', yearOfDeath: 1945 },
  { firstName: 'Napolean', lastName: 'Bonaparte', yearOfDeath: 1821 },
  { firstName: 'Abraham', lastName: 'Lincoln', yearOfDeath: 1865 },
  { firstName: 'Mother', lastName: 'Theresa', yearOfDeath: 1962 },
  { firstName: 'Mahatma', lastName: 'Gandhi', yearOfDeath: 1948 },
  { firstName: 'Winston', lastName: 'Churchill', yearOfDeath: 1965 },
  { firstName: 'Charles', lastName: 'Darwin', yearOfDeath: 1882 },
  { firstName: 'Albert', lastName: 'Einstein', yearOfDeath: 1955 },
  { firstName: 'Pablo', lastName: 'Picasso', yearOfDeath: 1973 },
  { firstName: 'Ludwig', lastName: 'Beethoven', yearOfDeath: 1827 },
  { firstName: 'Walt', lastName: 'Disney', yearOfDeath: 1966 },
  { firstName: 'Henry', lastName: 'Ford', yearOfDeath: 1947 },
  { firstName: 'Steve', lastName: 'Jobs', yearOfDeath: 2012 }
]
```
