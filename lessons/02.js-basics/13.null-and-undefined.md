# Null and Undefined

Let's cycle back to primitives. Earlier, you learned that there are six possible primitives in JavaScript:

1. String
2. Number
3. Boolean
4. Null
5. Undefined
6. Symbol

We'll focus on Null and Undefined values in this lesson.

## Undefined

`undefined` is a value that indicates an absence of a value. We say that something is `undefined` when it is not explicitly defined.

For example, if you declare a variable but did not assign anything to it, the variable will be `undefined`.

```js
let a
console.log(a) // undefined
```

If you have a function that returns nothing, the result of the function will be `undefined`.

```js
const returnsNothing = () {}

const test = returnsNothing()
console.log(test) // undefined
```

## Null

`null` is a value that is used to indicate "nothingness". Developers need to explicitly set a value to be `null`.

```js
const zell = {
  firstName: 'Zell',
  middleName: null,
  lastName: 'Liew'
}

console.log(zell.middleName) // null
```

## Null is different from undefined

If you compare `null` and `undefined` with the strictly equal operator, you'll get `false`.

```js
null === undefined // false
```

This is because `null` and `undefined` are different primitives.
