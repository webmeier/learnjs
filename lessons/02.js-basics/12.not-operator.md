## The NOT operator `!`

The NOT operator `!` flips truthy and falsey values around. Truthy values becomes `false` while falsey values become `true`.

```js
console.log(!22) // false
console.log(!false) // true
```

The NOT operator can be used to eliminate `else` statements, like this:

```js
const str = ''

if(!str) {
  // Only do something if string is NOT empty
}
```

## Double negation `!!`

You may notice that developers sometimes use two NOT operators together:

```js
!!someVariable
```

`!!` here is called a double negation. It does the following:

1. converts a truthy value to `true`
2. converts a falsey value to `false`.

It works this way: if the value is truthy, convert it to `false` with the first `!` NOT operator; then, convert `false` to `true` again with the second `!` NOT operator (and vice versa).

Double negation is used to explicitly cast a truthy or falsey value into a boolean (`true` or `false`). You'll almost never need it.
