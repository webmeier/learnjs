# Comments

You can write additional notes to help you think through problems in JavaScript. To write these additional notes, you use comments.

Comments appear in two forms:

1. `//`
2. `/* */`

## Commenting with //

You can write comments in JavaScript by adding double slashes (`//`). Anything after `//` is commented and will not be run by JavaScript.

```js
// This is a comment
```

You can write `//` comments anywhere in your code, even in the middle of a line, like this:

```js
const tables = 4 // 4 tables in the room
```

For the purpose of this course, whenever I `console.log` a variable from this point onwards, I would also write a comment that shows you what is printed in the console, like this:

```js
console.log(44) // 44
```

## Commenting with /\* \*/

You can also write comments with the `/* */` syntax. Any words between `/*` and `*/` is a comment.

```js
/* This is a comment */
```

You can write comments that span multiple lines if you use `/* */`:

```js
/*
    Everything
    is
    commented
    in
    this
    example.
*/
```
