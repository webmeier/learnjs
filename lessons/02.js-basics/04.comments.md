# Comments

Sometimes, you want to write additional notes for yourself when you write JavaScript to help you think through problems. You can do so with comments.

## Commenting with //

You can write comments in JavaScript by adding double slashes (`//`). If you do so, the entire line is commented, and would not be run by JavaScript.

```js
// This is a comment
```

You can write comments anywhere in your code, even in the middle of a line, like this:

```js
const tables = 4 // 4 tables in the room
```

For the purpose of this course, whenever I `console.log` a variable from this point onwards, I would also write a comment that shows you what is printed in the console, like this:

```js
console.log(44) // 44
```

## Commenting with /\* \*/

You can also write multiline comments in JavaScript by enclosing them between `/*` and `*/`:

```js
/*
 
    Everything 
    within 
    here 
    is 
    commented 

*/
```
