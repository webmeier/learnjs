# Null and Undefined

`null` and `undefined` are two primitives that are quite similar. They both indicate an absence of a value, and they both are falsey.

But, `null` and `undefined` are different.

```js
null === undefined // false
```

`null` is used by programmers to indicate that a variable does not contain a value. You explicitly assign a variable to `null` if required.

```js
const zell = {
  firstName: 'Zell',
  middleName: null,
  lastName: 'Liew'
}
```

`undefined` is used by JavaScript to tell us that a variable is either not declared, or does not have a value yet. As programmers, we do not assign variables the `undefined` value.

```js
const zell = {
  firstName: 'Zell',
  lastName: 'Liew'
}

console.log(zell.middleName) // undefined
```

That's the difference between `null` and `undefined`.
