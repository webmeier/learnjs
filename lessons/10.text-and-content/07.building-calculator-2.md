# Building a calculator (part 2)

You're going to learn to code for edge cases to make your calculator resilient to weird input patterns in this lesson.

You'll find the starter files for this lesson in `components/06.calculator/02.basic-part-1-completed`.

To do so, you have to imagine a troublemaker who tries to break your calculator by hitting keys in the wrong order. Let's call this troublemaker Tim.

<!--more-->

Tim can hit these keys in any order:

1. A number key (0-9)
2. An operator key (+, -, &times;, ÷)
3. The decimal key
4. The equal key
5. The clear key

## What happens if Tim hits the decimal key

If Tim hits a decimal key when the display already shows a decimal point, nothing should happen.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/decimal-multiple.gif" alt="Nothing happens when a user hits the decimal key when the display already shows a decimal point">
  <figcaption>Nothing happens when a user hits the decimal key when the display already shows a decimal point</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/decimal-multiple-2.gif" alt="Nothing should happen even if the previous key isn't the decimal key">
  <figcaption>Nothing should happen even if the previous key isn't the decimal key</figcaption>
</figure>

Here, we can check the displayed number contains a `.` with the `includes` method.

`includes` checks strings for a given match. If a string is found, it returns `true`; if not, it returns `false`. Note: `includes` is case sensitive

```js
// Example of how includes work.
const string = 'The hamburgers taste pretty good!'
const hasExclaimation = string.includes('!')

console.log(hasExclaimation) // true
```

```js
// Do nothing if string has a dot
if (!displayedNum.includes('.')) {
  display.textContent = displayedNum + '.'
}
```

Next, if Tim hits the decimal key after hitting an operator key, the display should show `0.`.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/decimal-after-operator.gif" alt="Display should show '0.' if a user hits a decimal key after an operator key">
  <figcaption>Display should show "0." if a user hits a decimal key after an operator key</figcaption>
</figure>

Here we need to know if the previous key is an operator. We can tell by checking the the custom attribute, `data-previous-key-type`, we set in the previous lesson.

`data-previous-key-type` is not complete yet. To correctly identify if `previousKeyType` is an operator, we need to update `previousKeyType` for each clicked key.

```js
if (!action) {
  // ...
  calculator.dataset.previousKeyType = 'number'
}

if (action === 'decimal') {
  // ...
  calculator.dataset.previousKeyType = 'decimal'
}

if (action === 'clear') {
  // ...
  calculator.dataset.previousKeyType = 'clear'
}

if (action === 'calculate') {
 // ...
  calculator.dataset.previousKeyType = 'calculate'
}
```

Once we have the correct `previousKeyType`, we can use it to check if the previous key is an operator.

```js
if (action === 'decimal') {
  if (!displayedNum.includes('.')) {
    display.textContent = displayedNum + '.'
  } else if (previousKeyType === 'operator') {
    display.textContent = '0.'
  }

  calculator.dataset.previousKeyType = 'decimal'
}
```

## What happens if Tim hits an operator key

First, if Tim hits an operator key first, the operator key should light up. (We've already covered for this edge case, but how? See if you can identify what we did).

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/operator-first.gif" alt="Operator key should light up if it's the first key.">
  <figcaption>Operator key should light up if it's the first key.</figcaption>
</figure>

Second, nothing should happen if Tim hits the same operator key multiple times. (We've already covered for this edge case as well).

Note: if you want to provide better UX, you can show the operator getting clicked on again and again with some CSS changes. We didn't do it here because I took recorded all the GIFs before I could fix that.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/operator-multiple.gif" alt="Operator key remains depressed if clicked on multiple times">
  <figcaption>Operator key remains depressed if clicked on multiple times</figcaption>
</figure>

Third, if Tim hits another operator key after hitting the first operator key, the first operator key should be released; the second operator key should be depressed. (We covered for this edge case too; but how?).

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/operator-switch.gif" alt="The new operator key should be depressed">
  <figcaption>The new operator key should be depressed</figcaption>
</figure>

Fourth, if Tim hits a number, an operator, a number and another operator, in that order, the display should be updated to a calculated value.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/operator-calc.gif" alt="Clicking on the operator when numbers are stored in the calculator results in a calculation">
  <figcaption>Clicking on the operator when numbers are stored in the calculator results in a calculation</figcaption>
</figure>

This means we need to use the `calculate` function when `firstValue`, `operator` and `secondValue` exists.

```js
if (
  action === 'add' ||
  action === 'subtract' ||
  action === 'multiply' ||
  action === 'divide'
) {
  const firstValue = calculator.dataset.firstValue
  const operator = calculator.dataset.operator
  const secondValue = displayedNum

  // Note: It's sufficient to check for firstValue and operator because secondValue always exists
  if (firstValue && operator) {
    display.textContent = calculate(firstValue, operator, secondValue)
  }

  key.classList.add('is-depressed')
  calculator.dataset.previousKeyType = 'operator'
  calculator.dataset.firstValue = displayedNum
  calculator.dataset.operator = action
}
```

Although we can calculate a value when the operator key is clicked for a second time, we have also introduced a bug at this point—additional clicks on the operator key calculates a value when it shouldn't.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/bug-operator-immed-calc.gif" alt="Bug: subsequent clicks on the operator performs a calculation when it shouldn't">
  <figcaption>Bug: subsequent clicks on the operator performs a calculation when it shouldn't</figcaption>
</figure>

To prevent the calculator from performing calculation on subsequent clicks on the operator key, we need to check if the `previousKeyType` is an operator; if it is, we don't perform a calculation.

```js
if (
  firstValue &&
  operator &&
  previousKeyType !== 'operator'
) {
  display.textContent = calculate(firstValue, operator, secondValue)
}
```

Fifth, after the operator key calculates a number, if Tim hits on a number, followed by another operator, the operator should continue with the calculation, like this: `8 - 1 = 7`, `7 - 2 = 5`, `5 - 3 = 2`.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/operator-consec-calc.gif" alt="Calculator should be able to continue calculation when a user clicks on numbers, followed by operators, followed by numbers, followed by operators, and so on.">
  <figcaption>Calculator should be able to continue calculation when a user clicks on numbers, followed by operators, followed by numbers, followed by operators, and so on.</figcaption>
</figure>

Right now, our calculator cannot make consecutive calculations. The second calculated value is wrong. Here's what we have: `99 - 1 = 98`, `98 - 1 = 0`.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/operator-consec-calc-bug.gif" alt="Calculated values are wrong. Second calculated value should be 97 instead of 0">
  <figcaption>Calculated values are wrong. Second calculated value should be 97 instead of 0</figcaption>
</figure>

The second value is calculated wrongly because we fed the wrong values into the `calculate` function. Let's go through a few pictures to understand what our code does.

### Understanding our calculate function

First, let's say a user clicks on a number, 99. At this point, nothing is registered in the calculator yet.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/op-consec-calc-1.png" alt="When a user hits numbers, the calculator doesn't register `firstValue` or `operator`">
  <figcaption>When a user hits numbers, the calculator doesn't register `firstValue` or `operator`</figcaption>
</figure>

Second, let's say the user clicks the subtract operator. After they click the subtract operator, we set `firstValue` to 99. We set also `operator` to subtract.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/op-consec-calc-2.png" alt="`firstValue` and `operator` are set after the operator button is clicked">
  <figcaption>`firstValue` and `operator` are set after the operator button is clicked</figcaption>
</figure>

Third, let's say the user clicks on a second value; this time, it's 1. At this point, the displayed number gets updated to 1, but our `firstValue`, `operator` and `secondValue` remains unchanged.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/op-consec-calc-3.png" alt="Display updates to 1, but `firstValue` and `operator` remains at `99` and `subtract`">
  <figcaption>Display updates to 1, but `firstValue` and `operator` remains at `99` and `subtract`</figcaption>
</figure>

Fourth, the user clicks on subtract again. Right after they click subtract, before we calculate the result, we set  `secondValue` as the displayed number.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/op-consec-calc-4.png" alt="We set `secondValue` to 1">
  <figcaption>We set `secondValue` to 1</figcaption>
</figure>

Fifth, we perform the calculation with `firstValue` 99, `operator` subtract, and `secondValue` 1. The result is 98.

Once the result is calculated, we set the display to the result. Then, we set `operator` to subtract, and `firstValue` to the previous displayed number.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/op-consec-calc-5.png" alt="After calculation, firstValue is set to `displayedNum`">
  <figcaption>After calculation, firstValue is set to `displayedNum`</figcaption>
</figure>

Well, that's terribly wrong! If we want to continue with the calculation, we need to update `firstValue` with the calculated value.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/op-consec-calc-6.png" alt="updates calculated value as `firstValue`">
  <figcaption>updates calculated value as `firstValue`</figcaption>
</figure>

```js
const firstValue = calculator.dataset.firstValue
const operator = calculator.dataset.operator
const secondValue = displayedNum

if (
  firstValue &&
  operator &&
  previousKeyType !== 'operator'
) {
  const calcValue = calculate(firstValue, operator, secondValue)
  display.textContent = calcValue

  // Update calculated value as firstValue
  calculator.dataset.firstValue = calcValue
} else {
  // If there are no calculations, set displayedNum as the firstValue
  calculator.dataset.firstValue = displayedNum
}

key.classList.add('is-depressed')
calculator.dataset.previousKeyType = 'operator'
calculator.dataset.operator = action
```

With this fix, consecutive calculations done by operator keys should now be correct.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/op-consec-calc-fixed.gif" alt="Consecutive calculations done with the operator key is now correct">
  <figcaption>Consecutive calculations done with the operator key is now correct</figcaption>
</figure>

## What happens if Tim hits the equal key?

First, nothing should happen if Tim hits the equal key before any operator keys,

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/equal-first.gif" alt="Calculator should show zero if equal key is hit first">
  <figcaption>Calculator should show zero if equal key is hit first</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/equal-after-num.gif" alt="When no calculation is required, display remains the same">
  <figcaption>When no calculation is required, display remains the same</figcaption>
</figure>

We know that operator keys have not been clicked yet if `firstValue` is not set to a number. We can use this knowledge to prevent the equal from calculating.

```js
if (action === 'calculate') {
  const firstValue = calculator.dataset.firstValue
  const operator = calculator.dataset.operator
  const secondValue = displayedNum

  if (firstValue) {
    display.textContent = calculate(firstValue, operator, secondValue)
  }

  calculator.dataset.previousKeyType = 'calculate'
}
```

Second, if Tim hits a number, followed by an operator, followed by a equal, the calculator should calculate the result such that:

1. `2 + =` —> `2 + 2 = 4`
2. `2 - =` —> `2 - 2 = 0`
3. `2 × =` —> `2 × 2 = 4`
4. `2 ÷ =` —> `2 ÷ 2 = 1`

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/num-op-equal.gif" alt="The calculator should treat first and second values as the same numbers if it's missing a value">
  <figcaption>The calculator should treat first and second values as the same numbers if it's missing a value</figcaption>
</figure>

We have already taken this weird input into account. Can you understand why? :)

Third, if Tim hits the equal key after a calculation is completed, another calculation should be performed again. Here's how the calculation should read:

1. Tim hits key 5 - 1
2. Tim hits equal. Calculated value is `5 - 1 = 4`
3. Tim hits equal. Calculated value is `4 - 1 = 3`
4. Tim hits equal. Calculated value is `3 - 1 = 2`
5. Tim hits equal. Calculated value is `2 - 1 = 1`
6. Tim hits equal. Calculated value is `1 - 1 = 0`

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/eq-consec-click-fixed.gif" alt="When a user hits the equal key multiple times, the calculator should continue to calculate">
  <figcaption>When a user hits the equal key multiple times, the calculator should continue to calculate</figcaption>
</figure>

Unfortunately, our calculator messes this calculation up. Here's what our calculator shows:

1. Tim hits key 5 - 1
2. Tim hits equal. Calculated value is `4`
3. Tim hits equal. Calculated value is `1`

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/eq-consec-calc-wrong.gif" alt="Equal key consecutive calculation gives a wrong result">
  <figcaption>Equal key consecutive calculation gives a wrong result</figcaption>
</figure>

### Correcting the calculation

First, let's say our user we clicks 5. At this point, nothing is registered in the calculator yet.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/eq-consec-calc-1.png" alt="When a user clicked on the first number the calculator doesn't register `firstValue` or `operator`">
  <figcaption>When a user clicked on the first number the calculator doesn't register `firstValue` or `operator`</figcaption>
</figure>

Second, let's say the user clicks the subtract operator. After they click the subtract operator, we set `firstValue` to 5. We set also `operator` to subtract.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/eq-consec-calc-2.png" alt="`firstValue` and `operator` are set after the operator button is clicked">
  <figcaption>`firstValue` and `operator` are set after the operator button is clicked</figcaption>
</figure>

Third, the user clicks on a second value. Let's say it's 1. At this point, the displayed number gets updated to 1, but our `firstValue`, `operator` and `secondValue` remains unchanged.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/eq-consec-calc-3.png" alt="Display updates to 1, but `firstValue` and `operator` remains at `5` and `subtract`">
  <figcaption>Display updates to 1, but `firstValue` and `operator` remains at `5` and `subtract`</figcaption>
</figure>

Fourth, the user clicks the equal key. Right after they click equal, but before the calculation, we set `secondValue` as `displayedNum`

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/eq-consec-calc-4.png" alt="`displayedNum` is set as `secondValue`">
  <figcaption>We set `secondValue` as `displayedNum` </figcaption>
</figure>

Fifth, the calculator calculates the result of `5 - 1` and gives `4`. The result gets updated to the display. `firstValue` and `operator` gets carried forward to the next calculation since we did not update them.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/eq-consec-calc-5.png" alt="`firstValue` and `operator` are used for the next operation">
  <figcaption>`firstValue` and `operator` are used for the next operation</figcaption>
</figure>

Sixth, when the user hits equal again, we set `secondValue` to `displayedNum` before the calculation.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/eq-consec-calc-6.png" alt="Once again, displayed num is set as the `secondValue` before the calculation">
  <figcaption>Once again, displayed num is set as the `secondValue` before the calculation</figcaption>
</figure>

You can tell what's wrong here.

Instead of `secondValue`, we want the set `firstValue` to the displayed number.

```js
if (action === 'calculate') {
  let firstValue = calculator.dataset.firstValue
  const operator = calculator.dataset.operator
  const secondValue = displayedNum

  if (firstValue) {
    if (previousKeyType === 'calculate') {
      firstValue = displayedNum
    }

    display.textContent = calculate(firstValue, operator, secondValue)
  }

  calculator.dataset.previousKeyType = 'calculate'
}
```

We also want to carry forward the previous `secondValue` into the new calculation. For `secondValue` to persist to the next calculation, we need to store it in another custom attribute. Let's call this custom attribute `modValue` (stands for modifier value).

```js
if (action === 'calculate') {
  let firstValue = calculator.dataset.firstValue
  const operator = calculator.dataset.operator
  const secondValue = displayedNum

  if (firstValue) {
    if (previousKeyType === 'calculate') {
      firstValue = displayedNum
    }

    display.textContent = calculate(firstValue, operator, secondValue)
  }

  // Set modValue attribute
  calculator.dataset.modValue = secondValue
  calculator.dataset.previousKeyType = 'calculate'
}
```

If the `previousKeyType` is `calculate`, we know we can use `calculator.dataset.modValue` as `secondValue`. Once we know this, we can perform the calculation.

```js
if (firstValue) {
  if (previousKeyType === 'calculate') {
    firstValue = displayedNum
    secondValue = calculator.dataset.modValue
  }

  display.textContent = calculate(firstValue, operator, secondValue)
}
```

With that, we have the correct calculation when the equal key is clicked consecutively.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/eq-consec-click-fixed.gif" alt="Consecutive calculations made by the equal key is now fixed">
  <figcaption>Consecutive calculations made by the equal key is now fixed</figcaption>
</figure>

### Back to the equal key

Fourth, if Tim hits a decimal key or a number key after the calculator key, the display should be replaced with `0.` or the new number respectively.

Here, instead of just checking if the `previousKeyType` is `operator`, we also need to check if it's `calculate`.

```js
if (!action) {
  if (
    displayedNum === '0' ||
    previousKeyType === 'operator' ||
    previousKeyType === 'calculate'
  ) {
    display.textContent = keyContent
  } else {
    display.textContent = displayedNum + keyContent
  }
  calculator.dataset.previousKeyType = 'number'
}

if (action === 'decimal') {
  if (!displayedNum.includes('.')) {
    display.textContent = displayedNum + '.'
  } else if (
    previousKeyType === 'operator' ||
    previousKeyType === 'calculate'
  ) {
    display.textContent = '0.'
  }

  calculator.dataset.previousKeyType = 'decimal'
}
```

Fifth, if Tim hits an operator key right after the equal key, calculator should NOT calculate.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/op-after-eq.gif" alt="Operator keys should not perform calculations if they're clicked after the equal key">
  <figcaption>Operator keys should not perform calculations if they're clicked after the equal key</figcaption>
</figure>

To do this, we check if the `previousKeyType` is `calculate` before performing calculations with operator keys.

```js
if (
  action === 'add' ||
  action === 'subtract' ||
  action === 'multiply' ||
  action === 'divide'
) {
  // ...

  if (
    firstValue &&
    operator &&
    previousKeyType !== 'operator' &&
    previousKeyType !== 'calculate'
  ) {
    const calcValue = calculate(firstValue, operator, secondValue)
    display.textContent = calcValue
    calculator.dataset.firstValue = calcValue
  } else {
    calculator.dataset.firstValue = displayedNum
  }

  // ...
}
```

## What happens if Tim hits the clear key?

The clear key has two uses:

1. All Clear (denoted by `AC`) clears everything and resets the calculator to its initial state.
2. Clear entry (denoted by `CE`) clears the current entry. It keeps previous numbers in memory.

When the calculator is in its default state, `AC` should be shown.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/default.png" alt="AC should be shown in the initial state">
  <figcaption>AC should be shown in the initial state</figcaption>
</figure>

First, if Tim hits a key (any key except clear), `AC` should be changed to `CE`.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/decimal-first.gif" alt="AC changes to CE when a key (except clear) gets hit">
  <figcaption>AC changes to CE when a key (except clear) gets hit</figcaption>
</figure>

We do this by checking if the `data-action` is `clear`. If it's not `clear`, we look for the clear button and change its `textContent`.

```js
if (action !== 'clear') {
  const clearButton = calculator.querySelector('[data-action=clear]')
  clearButton.textContent = 'CE'
}
```

Second, if Tim hits `CE`, the display should read 0. At the same time, `CE` should be reverted to `AC` so Tim can reset the calculator to its initial state.**

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/calculator/edge/clear.gif" alt="If CE is clicked, AC should show">
  <figcaption>If CE is clicked, AC should show</figcaption>
</figure>

```js
if (action === 'clear') {
  display.textContent = 0
  key.textContent = 'AC'
  calculator.dataset.previousKeyType = 'clear'
}
```

Third, if Tim hits `AC`, reset the calculator to its initial state.

To reset the calculator to its initial state, we need to clear all custom attributes we've set.

```js
if (action === 'clear') {
  if (key.textContent === 'AC') {
    calculator.dataset.firstValue = ''
    calculator.dataset.modValue = ''
    calculator.dataset.operator = ''
    calculator.dataset.previousKeyType = ''
  } else {
    key.textContent = 'AC'
  }

  display.textContent = 0
  calculator.dataset.previousKeyType = 'clear'
}
```

## Wrapping up

That's it! Building a calculator is hard, don't berate yourself if you cannot build a calculator without making mistakes.

For homework, write down all the edge cases mentioned above on a piece of paper, then proceed to build the calculator again from scratch. See if you can get the calculator up. Take your time, clear away your bugs one by one and you'll get your calculator up eventually.

While you do the homework, see if you can find any edge cases I missed :)

In the next lesson, you'll learn to refactor the calculator with best practices.
