# üõ†Ô∏è Dynamic popovers

The popover we created in the previous lesson is an overkill if you want to make popovers with simple content.

You'll see why if you look at the popover we've created so far. Our content is simple. There is only one paragraph tag in the popover.

```html
<div class="popover" data-placement="top">
  <p>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</p>
</div>
```

If the content is simple, we can make our lives easier as developers if we use JavaScript to make the popover for us. We can do that by stating the content within the trigger itself.

Then, we create the popover element with JavaScript.

## Adding content to the trigger

If we want to add content to the trigger, we need to use a custom attribute. Let's call this attribute `data-content`.

```html
<button
  class="trigger"
  data-placement="top"
  data-content="The quick brown ü¶ä jumps over the lazy üê∂">
  ...
</button>
```

## Creating the popover with JavaScript

We want our new code to work together with the code we wrote in the previous lesson. This means we need to pay attention to our old code first.

Here's the old code:

```js
triggers.forEach(trigger => {
  const popover =  document.querySelector(`#${trigger.dataset.target}`)
  const popoverPos = calcPopoverPos(trigger, popover)
  popover.style.left = `${popoverPos.left}px`
  popover.style.top = `${popoverPos.top}px`

  trigger.addEventListener('click', e => {
    popover.classList.toggle('is-displayed')
  })
})
```

If you pay attention to the code here, you'll notice that JavaScript needs to locate `popover` before it can calculate the popover's position.

If we want to create a popover with JavaScript, we need to create (and locate) the popover before we calculate its position.

But when should we locate a popover and when should we create a popover?

The answer lies in the trigger's custom attributes.

If the trigger contains a `data-target`, we locate the popover. If the trigger contains a `data-content`, we create a popover.

```js
const getPopover = trigger => {
  if (trigger.dataset.target) return document.querySelector(`#${trigger.dataset.target}`)
  if (trigger.dataset.content) // make and return Popover here
}

triggers.forEach(trigger => {
  const popover = getPopover(trigger)
  // ...
})
```

To make the popover, we can create a new function called `makePopover`.

```js
const getPopover = trigger => {
  if (trigger.dataset.target) return document.querySelector(`#${trigger.dataset.target}`)
  if (trigger.dataset.content) return makePopover()
}

const makePopover = _ => {
  // Make popover here
}
```

We know the popover we need to create is a `div` element. It needs to contain the `.popover` class. This popover also needs a `placement` custom attribute, which we can get from the trigger's `placement` custom attribute.

Finally, This popover should also contain some content, which we can get from the trigger's `content` custom attribute.

```js
const getPopover = trigger => {
  if (trigger.dataset.target) return document.querySelector(`#${trigger.dataset.target}`)
  if (trigger.dataset.content) return makePopover(trigger)
}

const makePopover = trigger => {
  const popover = document.createElement('div')
    popover.classList.add('popover')
    popover.dataset.placement = trigger.dataset.placement
    popover.innerHTML = `<p>${trigger.dataset.content}/<p>`
}
```

We need to append the popover element we created to the DOM. If we don't append it to the DOM, the popover doesn't exist.

```js
const makePopover = trigger => {
  const popover = document.createElement('div')
    popover.classList.add('popover')
    popover.dataset.placement = trigger.dataset.placement
    popover.innerHTML = `<p>${trigger.dataset.content}/<p>`

  document.body.appendChild(popover)
}
```

Finally, we need to return the popover element back to `getPopover`. `getPopover` will then return the popover back to the line of JavaScript that called it.

```js
const makePopover = trigger => {
  //...
  document.body.appendChild(popover)
  return popover
}
```

The popover should work as before. That's how you create a dynamic popover. Not too hard, right?

## Cleaning up

There are a few things we can clean up.

First you might want to destructure `content` and `placement` from `trigger.dataset` in `makePopover`. This will make the code a bit more readable.

```js
const makePopover = trigger => {
  const { placement, content }
  const popover = document.createElement('div')
    popover.classList.add('popover')
    popover.dataset.placement = placement
    popover.innerHTML = `<p>${content}/<p>`

  document.body.appendChild(popover)
}
```

Second, if the trigger has a `target`  custom attribute, it should not contain the `content` custom attribute. This means we don't need two `if` statements in `getPopover`. We can replace it with a ternary operator.

```js
const getPopover = trigger => {
  const target = trigger.dataset.target
  return target
    ? document.querySelector(`#${target}`)
    : makePopover(trigger)
}
```

## Wrapping up

You learned how to create dynamic popovers with JavaScript in this lesson. There's one more thing to do before we move on, and that's calculating the whitespace between the popover's arrow and the trigger. You'll learn how to do this in the next lesson.

For homework, try making a dynamic popover without looking at this lesson.
