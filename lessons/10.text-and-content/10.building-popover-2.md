## Creating the popover with JavaScript

We can create the popover with `document.createElement`. Once the popover is created, we will add into the DOM as the last element before the `</body>` tag closes.

You'll see why we add the element last when we position the popover. The order doesn't matter, but the element should be part of the body element. THe direct child of the body element.

Now, we want to put the popover as the child of the body element so it won't be affected by any transform contexts or `overflow: hidden` that you may use while creating the rest of your pages. This prevents future complications.

## Creating many popovers

4. Opening/closing the popover
  1. Create the Popover.
  2. Give it an ID
  3. Delete the popover
  4. Alternatively, slightly more complicated
    1. Create the popover
    2. Give the Popover a unique ID
    3. Hide the popover if closed
    4. Open the popover with its unique ID when it needs to be opened again.
5. Custom popover target
  1. Create a HTML for the popover target
  2. Give it an ID
  3. Adjust the popover component so it can take custom things like forms and content.
6. Wrapping up
7. Refactor time
