# üõ†Ô∏è Creating dots automatically for the carousel

Previously, when we created the HTML, we made the dots manually. Here's what we wrote:

```html
<section class="carousel">
  <!-- ... -->
  <div class="carousel__track-container">
    <ul class="carousel__track">
      <li class="carousel__slide is-selected"> ... </li>
      <li class="carousel__slide"> ... </li>
      <li class="carousel__slide"> ... </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- ... -->

  <div class="carousel__nav">
    <button class="carousel__dot is-selected"> ...</button>
    <button class="carousel__dot"> ... </button>
    <button class="carousel__dot"> ... </button>
  </div>
</section>
```

We should not create the HTML for the dots manually because the number of dots should correspond to the number of slides. These dots can be created with JavaScript.

## Creating dots with JavaScript

Let's make a function called `makeDots` to create the dots.

```js
const makeDots = _ =>  {
  // ...
}
```

From the HTML, we know that the carousel needs a container. This container is a `<div>` with a `carousel__nav` class.

```js
const makeDots = _ =>  {
  const container = document.createElement('div')
  container.classList.add('carousel__nav')
}
```

We need to make the same number of dots and slides. We can get the number of slides in the container with `slides`.

Each dot is a button. This button has the `carousel__dot` class.

```js
const makeDots = slides =>  {
  // ...
  slides.forEach(slide => {
    const dot = document.createElement('button')
    dot.classList.add('carousel__dot')
  })
}
```

The first dot should have the `is-selected` class, just like how the first slide has the `is-selected` class. We can check for the first dot with two ways:

1. Use the index. If index is 0, we know its the first dot.
2. Use the slide. If `slide` contains the `is-selected` class, we know its the selected slide.

Both methods work so you can choose either method. I'm going to choose the second method.

```js
const makeDots = slides =>  {
  // ...
  slides.forEach(slide => {
    const dot = document.createElement('button')
    dot.classList.add('carousel__dot')
    if (slide.classList.contains('is-selected')) {
      dot.classList.add('is-selected')
    }
  })
}
```

We also need to add the slide into the container. We can do this with `appendChild`.

```js
const makeDots = slides =>  {
  // ...
  slides.forEach(slide => {
    const dot = document.createElement('button')
    dot.classList.add('carousel__dot')
    if (slide.classList.contains('is-selected')) {
      dot.classList.add('is-selected')
    }

    container.appendChild(dot)
  })
}
```

Finally, we need to add the dot container into the DOM. We can do this with `appendChild` again. Since we want to append the dot into the carousel, in makes sense to pass the carousel into `makeDots` as a variable.

```js
const makeDots = (carousel, slides) =>  {
  // ...

  carousel.appendChild(container)
}
```

We can use `makeDots` this way:

```js
const carousel = document.querySelector('.carousel')
const track = carousel.querySelector('.carousel__track')
const slides = [...track.children]

makeDots(carousel, slides)
```

By the way, since we need to find the carousel in our JavaScript file, we can use `carousel.querySelector` instead of `document.querySelector`. This makes our search more specific.

```js
const dotsContainer = carousel.querySelector('.carousel__nav')
const dots = [...dotsContainer.children]
const nextButton = carousel.querySelector('.jsNext')
const prevButton = carousel.querySelector('.jsPrev')
```

Now, we can remove the `.carousel__nav` we created manually from the HTML. All event listeners should work like normal.

## Making and assigning dotContainer

This code is a bit redundant.

```js
makeDots(carousel, slides)
const dotsContainer = carousel.querySelector('.carousel__nav')
```

It says: Make the dots (which creates the container and the dots), then search the DOM for the element that has the `.carousel__nav` class (which points back to the container).

We can combine both statements into one if we return the dotsContainer as after making it.

```js
const makeDots = (carousel, slides) => {
  // ...
  return container
}
const dotsContainer = makeDots(carousel, slides)
```

The carousel should still work as normal.

## Wrapping up

The carousel requires JavaScript to work. If it requires JavaScript, you can always create elements with JavaScript.

In this case, we can create the dots because there is a pattern to the dots. If you want to, you can even create the previous button and the next button with JavaScript.

Try it!
