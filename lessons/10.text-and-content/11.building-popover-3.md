# üõ†Ô∏è Improving the popover's space variable

We set the leftover space for arrows and whitespace to be 20px as we built the popover. This is fine at first, but if you change the popover's size, this whitespace goes out of whack.

If you look at the CSS for the popover, you will understand that the arrows on the popover are created with CSS. If you dive into the CSS, you will notice they use the `em` unit.

```css
.popover[data-placement="top"]::after {
  border-left: 1em solid transparent;
  border-right: 1em solid transparent;
  border-top: 0.75em solid #fff;
  bottom: -0.75em;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
}
```

One em unit represents the font-size of the element. If you change the popover's font-size, the arrow size will change accordingly.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/popover/space/change-font-size.gif" alt="Size of the popover's arrow increases as font-size increases">
  <figcaption>Size of the popover's arrow increases as font-size increases</figcaption>
</figure>

If we want the popover's placement to be correct regardless of the font-size of our popover, the `space` used in the calculation must be calculated with the `em` unit.

## Getting the em unit

To get the `em` unit, we can use `getComputedStyle`. One `em` is always equal to the font-size of the element. In this case, we can use the font-size of the popover as the a guide.

```js
const getOneEm = element => {
  const style = getComputedStyle(element)
  return style.fontSize
}
```

If you use Standard as your linter, you may notice that it complains that `getComputedStyle` is not defined.

This happens because Standard doesn't recognize `getComputedStyle` style as a global variable. You can fix by writing `window.getComputedStyle` or by writing `/* globals getComputedStyle */` at the top of your code.

We can use `getOneEm` this way:

```js
const calcPopoverPos = (trigger, popover) => {
  // ...
  const space = getOneEm(trigger)
  // ...
```

You can then calculate the amount of space you want through `getOneEm`. In this case, the value of `1em` is `18px`. If you want 20px worth of space, you'll set `space` to ` getOneEm(trigger) * 1.111`.

I felt that `1.2em` worth of space looks best, so I'll set the space to `1.2em`.

```js
const space = oneEm(trigger) * 1.2
```

## Wrapping up

You learned how to get the value of `1em` through getComputedStyle in this lesson. What else can you use `getComputedStyle` for?

Brainstorm a few possible use cases and discuss what you think in the community.
