# Template Literals

In the next few lessons, you're also going to create `console.log` statements that contain variables. So, it makes sense to learn another new feature that helps with creating strings that contain variables. This feature is called **template literals** or **template strings**.

## Creating variables with template literals

Let's say you have a function called `sayName` that `console.log` the `firstName` and `lastName` of a person.

To `console.log` variables like `firstName` and `lastName`, what you have to do to split up variables and strings with the `+` operator. This `+` operator allows you to concatenate strings together.

```js
function sayName (firstName, lastName, teamName) {
  console.log(firstName + ' ' + lastName)
}

sayName('Zell', 'Liew') // Zell Liew
```

It's quite clunky.

**Template literals are strings that begin and end with backticks** (\`).

In template literals, any variables within `${}` behave like normal Javascript. Anything outside `${}` are normal strings.

So, you can easily mix strings and variables like this:

```js
function sayName (firstName, lastName, teamName) {
  console.log(`${firstName} ${lastName}`)
}

sayName('Zell', 'Liew') // Zell Liew
```

(Note: The space between `firstName` and `lastName` is a normal string).

## Multi-line strings

Template literals also let you create strings that span multiple lines, like this:

```js
const multi = `One upon a time,
In a land far far away,
there lived a witch,
who could change night into day`
```

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/es6/multiline.png" alt="Am image showing the multi variable logged into the console ">
  <figcaption aria-hidden>Strings can span multiple lines with template literals</figcaption>
</figure>

## Wrapping up

Template literals make it super easy for you to create strings that contain variables and strings that span multiple lines.

Template literals also bring about another feature – tags – that you've not learned yet. You can find out more about tags if you like over at [this article](http://wesbos.com/tagged-template-literals/). I've never found a real use case for it yet.

## Exercise

1. `console.log` a string that contains a variable with template literals
2. `console.log` a string that spans multiple lines with template literals
