# What is object oriented programming?

Many different things to talk about OOP here. PRobably need to talk about how they have already used OOP all along ‚Äì and that's when they write about

Constructors
Encapsulation
SOLID Principle
Decoupling?
Inheritance
Object Composition
Mixins
Prototypes
Prototypal inheritance? The one that Eric Elliot keeps saying. Multiple inheritance? uhhh.

Okay, it gets a little confusing over here, because Javascript doesn't support inheritance
And have to talk about Javascript classes and whether to use them.
Patterns?

The `new` keyword. Should you use it? There are arguments to both sides. Then you kinda need to explore a little bit on the constructor end. Factory pattern vs the new keyword.

Anyway, OOP has the concept of a class. But Javascript doesn't have the concept of a class. Hm, so that makes things especially challenging here.


How does OOP work?
Creating new objects
Instances vs constructors
getter and setter functions
Factory pattern

The __proto__ property of Object.prototype is an accessor property (a getter function and a setter function) that exposes the internal [[Prototype]] (either an object or null) of the object through which it is accessed.

So what exactly is a prototype?
So here‚Äôs where an analogy would be helpful. I wonder what a good analogy should be, I keep thinking of chain because prototype chain, but that‚Äôs kind of lame and useless.
Maybe some sorry about bloodlines and specific special abilities. So you imagine that bloodline has different capabilities. At the TOP, invicinvld to fire. Resistant to wind. Has the ability to heal () and blah. So let‚Äôs say that‚Äôs your parent. And you parent has these abilities. Right. You grandad has the ability to learn any skill he wants to? Nah that‚Äôs kind of lame.ahne resist light and dark.
And then you learned how to sing. Who know why you became a bard/Dancer, but that‚Äôs not the big question. The thing is, you intuitive have fire resistance, wind resistance, can heal and can sing at the same time!
But when you ask yourslef, where did you learn it? You shrug. It‚Äôs not within your capabilities.
But if you trace up the bloodline, things become obvious. Ah. Your parents learned it and passed it on to you.
The prototype chain is like a bloodline. Objects ‚Äúlearned‚Äù properties and methods because someone else (you can too!) defined them that way and passed them on to you.
That‚Äôs why array can have find and filter - that‚Äôs because the Array base array subject has the method!
And with that I can kinda end the prototype lesson, because that‚Äôs the gist of it.
Then after the prototype lesson, I kinda need to go back to OOP, here I should probably talk about call, bind and apply, because I‚Äôll need to use them.
Oh! Before this, I can also Tak about object laterals! (Maybe even before what is OOP would be a good place).
And yeah, so because I need to use call much later hm. Only during constructor functions then I need call bind apply right. So why?
Maybe I should switch prototype and this, because this followed by cbs makes the most sense.
After call bind apply, I want to start talking about interitancs - classical inheritance. That‚Äôs called subtyping. It‚Äôs also called classical inheritance because traditional OOP languages have this notion of class (instead of one Jr‚Äôs) so I have no idea why they‚Äôre called obeject oreiented dinctead of class selfie ted but that‚Äôs another topic entirely /rant.
And why do I want to discuss subtyping? Well - that‚Äôs the main form of inheritance that‚Äôs being taught to beginners, so you can start there.
Then after intheritancs m, can explore different ways to create objects - object.create vs factory functions CD constructor functions vs classes. (There are actually four ways to create object in Javascript, and people teach all 4 of them in some way or another, and mix them all up). Here, I want to show you the difference between four of them, and which one you should pick for all your OOP code. There‚Äôs a clear winner.
Ready go!
Then explain them all, Plus talk abit the inheritance part. Leave private card out first, but I‚Äôll need to come back to them later.
No actually private methods hm ü§î. It can come later, because I want to teach the right method first, then go into the specific best practices. And I could include one part about best practices for OOP. No I‚Äôm not going to talk about solid because that‚Äôs just so hard to understand. But I kinda need to go through them.
Single responsibility of course. Ah. I had a few up my mind. Don‚Äôt inherit more than 1 level. You won‚Äôt have a need to do so usually. So don‚Äôt bother.
And ah. Don‚Äôt cuss clssss for sure. Use other methods. And well, generallly others I need to think about. Maybe a don‚Äôt use es6 arrow functions for creating objects because they break the this content!
Before private methods I wanna talk about composition and multiple inheritance. That‚Äôs a topic that many people get confused about too, especially with Eric Elliot shouting loudly about how the whole topic. And you know, I never have a good answer to any question people ask me. I‚Äôm still learning too, and I‚Äôll learn and get back to them ;). Usually great questions are important!
Okay, in the composition and inheritance topic there‚Äôs a question regarding what is multiple inheritance? Can you inherit from more than one object? If yes, how?
Multiple inheritance is not possible in Javascript. Because well, diamond problem explaination. Plus it‚Äôs not recommended.
But you do have cases where you want methods from other places like say Desinger developer, designer developer and probably talk about ah. So here‚Äôs he thing, need to talk about composition over inheritance first.
Then go into multiple inheritance (optional topic for another day maybe, where I clear up on micins vs composition) a lot of theory to absorb here :(
And you know what? I‚Äôm pretty much done! Good job!

```
Object.create = function(o) {
  function F() {}
  F.prototype = o;
  return new F();
}
```

```
var extend = function(childClass, parentClass) {
  childClass.prototype = new parentClass();
  childClass.prototype.constructor = childClass;
}
```

And explain it could be the same. This is actually built into `Class`. But I don't like it. But you can use it. I prefer using functions because they remind me of the real nature of all Javascript functions ‚Äì they're functions, not classes.

Because every Human has the ability to say their name, you can create group these people into a generic `Human` object.

```js
const Human = {
  sayName () {
    // Note: Don't worry about 'this' yet. You'll understand it later. Follow along for now.
    console.log(`I am ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}!`)
  }
}
```

Now, wouldn't it be nice if you could create different people from this `Human` object? Turns out, you can do so by using `Object.create`!

```js
const zell = Object.create(Human)
```

Now, if you `console.log` the human you've just created, you'll realize he's nothing special. He doesn't have a name, nor age yet, but he has the ability to say his name.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/oop/what-is-oop/instance-has-method.png" alt="Image showing that the zell instance has a sayName method in the prototype. ">
  <figcaption aria-hidden="true"> zell has a sayName method </figcaption>
</figure>

If you tried to ask `zell` to say his name, he'll say something weird.

```js
zell.sayName() // I am undefined undefined!
```

Obviously, Zell's name isn't `undefined undefined`! It should be `Zell Liew`!

You need to create an identity for each person you create with `Object.create`. To do so, you can create a `init` function that kick-starts the human creation process.

```js
const Human = {
  init (firstName, lastName, age) {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
    this.age = age
  },

  sayName () {
    console.log(`I am ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}!`)
  }
}
```

Now, whenever you create a new person with `Object.create`, you can run `person.init` to provide them with their individual details.

```js
const zell = Object.create(human)
zell.init('Zell', 'Liew', 29)
```


(Note: `Human` is supposed to be called a constructor in traditional Object Oriented Programming. Unfortunately, a constructor already means something else in Javascript, so I'm calling `Human` a constructing object instead).
