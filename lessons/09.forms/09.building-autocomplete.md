Autocompleteâ€”mention datalist (and says at the time of writing, it only works on Chrome, plus styling is limited, so you might want to refrain from it unless you're okay with default styles. But if you want to build a custom datalist, as we will, you'll need to take care of accessibility yourself (which we will go into later for more info)).

- https://github.com/mledoze/countries
- data: https://github.com/mledoze/countries/blob/master/dist/countries.json

- What we're gonna use: https://restcountries.eu/ (because it provides an API. But usually, when we're building things, we don't want to rely on this API, since you don't really need countries). You can default back to https://github.com/mledoze/countries for a full list of info you want.

// Later improvements

1. Keyboard up/down key should highlight popover item
2. Keyboard tab key should populate with item
