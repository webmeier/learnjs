# Building a popover

Okay, I have a few things I want to say about building a popover right now, because I don't really know what is good far a popover thing. When I write it down, it might help, I'm hoping it'll help actually, so I'm writing it, because I have promised myself that I will continue to write whatever that comes to mind, even when it means I haven't thought closely baout stuff yet because maybe writing things down will help me think about things.

So anyway, for the popover, I'm considering using Sivam's thingy for the popover because the playstation buttons feel fun and quirky. I'm not sure if you can use the playstations buttnos outright because it might be infringement, so that's not gonna be fun. But well, popovers are fun. I should provide an actual usage of a popover, like on the ipad screen or something, or when applications show a popover. THat'll help with visualizing how a person would use a popover.

So then, popovers contain information, much like modal windows, so the process is actually very similar. But there's a slight difference, because popovers need to be positioned in a specific way. It needs to be placed close to the clicked item.

One way to create a popover is through the use of the hover or click method? Maybe? Thinking about the structure, because it's nearby, you may want to create the popover such that it's directly nested as a child or something.

But you won't want to, because of the possibility of setting over hidden on the parent element. I've tried it before, when I created a carousel and clients required a popover, and that carousel's popover was so long that it got cut off from the overflow. Not a fun thing to work with this way.

Popovers are slightly more complex, because you want to consider if the popover messages are similar to each other. If the popover messages are similar, you can get the popover message from the element itself, which is what we're gonna do, because our popoover is pretty similar—they have an image and some text.

Moreover, you already know how to create a module window, so doing that with a strictly new message wouldn't be that hard anymore, so let's up the challenge a little bit.

Yep, so that's the part about buliding the popover, I'm gonna need to think about the playstation one then, and how to flesh out the content.

## Creating the popover

Well, there are a few things to consider when creating a popover, normally, you want to think about:

1. What's the height of the popover?
2. What's the width?
3. Where should it be placed?
4. What's the content that needs to go into each popover?

We should answer the content question first. But then, put aside the content question because we already have an answer—that we're gonna bulid the content out and create it as data messages or something.

So the other question that reamins is the popover height, width and location. The height is usually determined by the content. The width, can be predetermined, and it's pretty important to determine it first, because it'll inform the location of the popover.

To find out where the popover should be placed, you need to figure out where the element is, and whether there's enough space for the popover to appear.

If the element is at the top, and there's no space at the top, the popover should appear at the bottom of the element. These are constraints that have to be met.

Otherwise, you might want to display the popover with a certain angle. Let's go with four locations, top, bottom, left and right, Each popover needs to be based in the center. You can enhance your popover to contain eight locations (top-left, top, top-right, right, bottom-right, bottom, bottom-left, and left) if you wish to.

There are a few things we need to settle offhand, first of all, it's the default HTML and styles. We already mentioned the default HTML should be similar no something like XX and you should alerady get the styles from the starter file, so we don't havet o worry about most of them. Good.

What's next? Yeah, finding the position of the text. For now, let's use a lorem ipsum text while we place the position of the thing.

```
```

### Placing the element in the right location

To place the element in the correct location, we need to create new elements with JavaScript. These elements need to have a position of `absolute` so they can be shifted anywhere with ease. They also need to have a ... what's that again? Fixed height and width, so let's give it a class for simple measure.

.popover {

}

Yep. Once they're done, you need to figure out where to build the popover. Let's work with the `top` option for now.

```
```

When the popover is at the top, you need to give the pop-over a `top` class or something to create the additional arrows. Maybe I won't talk about this, but hey, there needs to be some space for the arrows anayway.

We want to center the popover with the element in question, so we kinda have to figure out what's the correct left value we need.

That'll depend on the element's `left` and `width` property.

```
```

Do some math, here's where the math part comes in, maybe with a diagram to help you calculate the centering part of it all. And of course some text instructions that seem to be alluding my head right now.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

Yeah, Uh, I need to draw too, so I need my thingy because I cannot think without it.

So anyway, first of all we need to find the center of the element with `getBoundingClientRect`. This value will be half of the `left` and `right` values.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

Then, we can find the `left` property of the popover by using the center value - half if the popover's width:

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

```
```

Next, we need to position the property from the top. To find the correct positions, we need to use `getBoundingClientRect` to know the current element's position from the current page, and `pageYOffset` to know what's the current scroll position.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

To get the top and left position of an element relative to the document, we first determine the X/Y coordinates of an element on the screen via getBoundingClientRect(). We then add scroll top/left position to these coordinates. Helper function:

```
function offset(el) {
    var rect = el.getBoundingClientRect(),
    scrollLeft = window.pageXOffset || document.documentElement.scrollLeft,
    scrollTop = window.pageYOffset || document.documentElement.scrollTop;
    return { top: rect.top + scrollTop, left: rect.left + scrollLeft }
}
```

The `top` property of the popover should be scrollY + elemTop - height - offset from the element.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

```
```

And there we positioned the popover correctly on the top. Now, we need to position the popover properly on the other three edges.

### Positioning popover on the bottom

Positioning popover on the bottom is simple. We follow the same steps, but add the popover height to the bottom of the element button

  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

```
```

### Positioning popover on the right

To position the popover on the right, we need to reverse the calculations abit, because finding the left value is not a simple feat. ACtually it is ba, the left value would be the same as err, you know the right of the element + the offset. Simple as that.

```
```

For the height, we need to caluclate the height such that it's half...

### Positioning popover on the left

To position the popover on the left, you need to calculate the

```
```

## Selecting positions?

Meh, so we've done a lot of positinoing at this point. You can select up/down/left/right and the positions would appear properly

```html
```

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

A lot of math involved. Woo!

## Automatically positioning popovers

Now, let's say you've selected your popover to appear on the right. But what if there's not enough space on the right?

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

Then you'll be able to scroll post the window, which creates a bad UX. What you want to do is to ensure your popover appears as natural as possible, in the right place.

We can set a few constraints:

1. If the popover cannot appear in the right, we try to set it to the left.
2. If the popover cannot appear properly on the left, we set it to the bottom.
3. If it still fails, try to top.
4. If all directions fails, set the popover to the bottom and let text flow over window. That's fine, because we're still maintaining the UX.
5. In some cases, you might need to change the width of the element to match the viewpont, so we'll do some calculations then too.

In this section, we'll think about the positioning part. There's more math involved!

Okay, I'm a bit tired from thinking about this right now, and I don't seem to be able to write it without knowing what the code actually look slike, but it should be similar to this:

1. Calculate width of the screen
3. Calculate left + width. Does it exceed width of screen?
4. Change to right.
5. Calculate left + width. Does it ovelap original button?
6. Change to bottom.
7. Calculate top + height. Does it exceed height of screen?
8. Change to top.
9. Calculate top + height. Does it overlap button?
10. Set to bottom and let it exceed the height.

## Popover on mobile

1. Calculate width of the screen
2. Does width of popover exceed width of screen? If yes, set popover to width of screen - 2em or something, so it can be positioned properly in the center like a modal window.
3. Calculate left + width. Does it exceed width of screen?
4. Change to right.
5. Calculate left + width. Does it ovelap original button?
6. Change to bottom.
7. Calculate top + height. Does it exceed height of screen?
8. Change to top.
9. Calculate top + height. Does it overlap button?
10. Set to bottom and let it exceed the height.

Done

Then, popover part 2 maybe?

That's used to create the popover content itself. Basically, creating the popover content requires you to set get the data. Then create tags, and set the correct attributes.

ANd viola!
