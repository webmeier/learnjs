# Selecting multiple elements

Let's say you want to change the text color of all your paragraph elements from black to red now. How do you begin?

At this point, you know that you can only set inline styles with JavaScript. There is no way you can target a `<p>` tag with CSS to change the color of every single paragraph.

Since you don't know how many paragraph elements are on the page, writing `querySelector` for each `<p>` tag is impossible too.

This is where `querySelectorAll` comes to the rescue.

## querySelectorAll

`querySelectorAll` lets you select multiple elements at the same time. The syntax of `querySelectorAll` is almost exactly the same as `querySelector`.

```js
const NodeList = Element.querySelectorAll(selector)
```

The selector you'd write with `querySelectorAll` is the same selectors you'd write with CSS. So:

- **To select an element with an ID**, you prepend it with `#`
- **To select an element with a class**, you prepend it with `.`
- **To select an element with a tag**, you write the tag name directly
- **To select an element with an attribute**, you write the attribute in square (`[]`) brackets.

```html
<p>Paragraph 1</p>
<p>Paragraph 2</p>
<p>Paragraph 3</p>
```

```js
const paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll('p')
```

</figure>

The only difference here is that `querySelectorAll` returns a **NodeList** instead of an Element.

A NodeList is a list of Nodes. An Element is a specific type of Node. So, you if you `querySelectorAll`, the returned Nodelist is a list of Elements.

(See next lesson on Nodes vs Elements if you're unsure how to differentiate between the two).

## Acting on each element

As you know, `querySelectorAll` returns a NodeList. You cannot use properties like `Element.style` directly on a NodeList. You also cannot use methods like `Element.querySelector` directly on the NodeList.

To use the methods on the Elements, you need to loop through the NodeList either with a `for` loop or a `Array.forEach` loop.

To change the text color of all paragraphs from black to red, you can set the inline style of each Element as you loop through them with `forEach` (a `for` loop is generally harder to maintain, than a `forEach` loop. Use `forEach` whenever possible).

```js
const paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll('p')
paragraphs.forEach(element => element.style.color = 'red')
```

Note: In older browsers, NodeLists may not have a `forEach` loop built into them yet. If you encounter this scenario, you can convert your NodeList into an Array with `Array.from`.

```js
const elementArray = Array.from(NodeList)

// Or, to make the conversion directly
const elementArray2 = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(selector))
```

## Getting a specific Element from a list of NodeList

Since a NodeList behaves similarly to an array, you can select the nth-item in the list just like how you select the nth-item in arrays.

```js
const paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll('p')
const firstParagraph = paragraphs[0]

console.log(firstParagraph)
// <p>Paragraph 1</p>
```

## Alternate methods to select multiple elements

You may have heard that you can select multiple elements with methods like `getElementsByClassName` and `getElementsByTagName`. Should you use them?

The quick answer is: feel free to use them if you want to. They're slightly quicker than `querySelectorAll`, and they return live collections (lists) while `querySelectorAll` returns a non-live collection.

Most of the time, the speed difference is negligible and the live/non-live collection difference doesn't matter much. So, I choose `querySelectorAll` any day.

To get a more informed opinion, it may make sense to look at live vs non-live collections.

## Live vs non-live collections

Lets say you have the following HTML:

```html
<p>Paragraph 1</p>
<p>Paragraph 2</p>
<p>Paragraph 3</p>
```

And you've selected the paragraphs with both `querySelectorAll` and `getElementsByTagName`.

```js
const liveCollection = document.getElementsByTagName('p')
const staticCollection = document.querySelectorAll('p')
```

At this point, both `liveCollection` and `staticCollection` refers to the same thing â€“ the three paragraphs.

If you add another paragraph through JavaScript sometime later, `liveCollection` will update itself and include the fourth paragraph. `staticCollection`, on the other hand, will remain as the three paragraphs you selected initially.

That's the difference between live and non-live collections. It does have an impact in specific situations, but there's no need to worry about it most of the time. You'll see why as we build things together in the videos.

## Exercise

Practice selecting Elements with `querySelectorAll`. Try selecting the Star Wars characters with both classes and attributes:

```html
<div id="star-wars">
  <div class="character" data-type="hero">Luke Skywalker</div>
  <div class="character" data-type="master">Yoda</div>
  <div class="character" data-type="villain">Darth Vader</div>
</div>
```

Try the following while using `querySelectorAll`:

1. Change `fontSize` of all characters to `2em`
2. Change Luke's text to `white` and `backgroundColor` to `black`
3. Change Yoda's text to `green`.
4. Change Darth Vader's text to `red`.

Note: For this exercise, stick to `querySelectorAll`. Do not use `querySelector`.
