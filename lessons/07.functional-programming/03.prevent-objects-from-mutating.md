# Preventing Objects from mutating

Mutation can be scary. The question is, how can you prevent objects from mutating without you knowing?

There are two answers: `Object.assign` and `assignment`.

## Object.assign

`Object.assign` lets you combine two (or more) objects together into a single one. It has the following syntax:

```js
const newObject = Object.assign(object1, object2, object3, object4)
```

`newObject` will contain properties from all of the objects you’ve passed into Object.assign.

```js
const papayaBlender = { canBlendPapaya: true }
const mangoBlender = { canBlendMango: true }

const fruitBlender = Object.assign(papayaBlender, mangoBlender)

console.log(fruitBlender)
// {
//   canBlendPapaya: true,
//   canBlendMango: true
// }
```

If two conflicting properties are found, the property in a later object overwrites the property in an earlier object.

```js
const smallCupWithEar = {
  volume: 300,
  hasEar: true
}

const largeCup = { volume: 500 }

// In this case, volume gets overwritten from 300 to 500
const myIdealCup = Object.assign(smallCupWithEar, largeCup)

console.log(myIdealCup)
// {
//   volume, 500,
//   hasEar: true
// }
```

**But beware! When you combine two objects with `Object.assign`, the first object gets mutated. Other objects don’t get mutated.**

```js
console.log(smallCupWithEar)
// {
//   volume, 500,
//   hasEar: true
// }

console.log(largeCup)
// {
//   volume, 500
// }
```

### Preventing `Object.assign` from mutating objects

You can pass a new object as your first object to prevent existing objects from mutating. You’ll still mutate the first object (the empty object) though, but that’s OK since this mutation doesn’t affect anything else.

```js
const smallCupWithEar = {
  volume: 300,
  hasEar: true
}

const largeCup = {
  volume: 500
}

// Using a new object as the first argument.
const myIdealCup = Object.assign({}, smallCupWithEar, largeCup)
```

You can mutate your new object however you want from this point. It doesn’t affect any of your previous objects.

```js
myIdealCup.picture = 'Mickey Mouse'
console.log(myIdealCup)
// {
//   volume, 500,
//   hasEar: true
//   picture: 'Mickey Mouse'
// }

// smallCupWithEar doesn't get mutated
console.log(smallCupWithEar)
// {
//   volume, 300,
//   hasEar: true
// }

// largeCup doesn't get mutated as well
console.log(largeCup)
// {
//   volume, 500
// }
```

## But `Object.assign` copies references to objects

The problem with Object.assign is that it performs a **shallow merge**—it copies properties directly from one object to another. When it does so, it also copies references to any objects.

Let’s explain this statement with an example.

Suppose you buy a new sound system. The system allows you to declare whether the power is turned on. It also lets you set the volume, the amount of bass, and other options.

```js
const defaultSettings = {
  power: true,
  soundSettings: {
    volume: 50,
    bass: 20,
    // other options
  }
}
```

Some of your friends love loud music, so you decide to create a preset that’s guaranteed to wake your neighbors when they’re asleep.

```js
const loudPreset = {
  soundSettings: {
    volume: 100
  }
}
```

Then you invite your friends over for a party. To preserve your existing presets, you attempt to combine your loud preset with the default one.

```js
const partyPreset = Object.assign({}, defaultSettings, loudPreset)
```

But `partyPreset` sounds weird. The volume is loud enough, but the bass is non-existent. When you inspect `partyPreset`, you’re surprised to find that there’s no bass in it!

```js
console.log(partyPreset)
// {
//   power: true,
//   soundSettings: {
//     volume: 100
//   }
// }
```

This happens because JavaScript copies over the reference to the `soundSettings` object. Since both `defaultSettings` and loudPreset have a `soundSettings` object, the one that comes later gets copied into the new object.

If you change `partyPreset`, `loudPreset` will mutate accordingly—evidence that the reference to `soundSettings` gets copied over.

```js
partyPreset.soundSettings.bass = 50

console.log(loudPreset)
// {
//   soundSettings: {
//     volume: 100,
//     bass: 50
//   }
// }
```

Since `Object.assign` performs a shallow merge, you need to use another method to merge objects that contain nested properties (that is, objects within objects).

Enter assignment.

## Assignment

`assignment` is a [small library](https://github.com/bevacqua/assignment/blob/master/assignment.js) made by [Nicolás Bevacqua](https://twitter.com/nzgb) from [Ponyfoo](https://ponyfoo.com), which is a great source for JavaScript knowledge. It helps you perform a deep merge without having to worry about mutation. Aside from the method name, the syntax is the same as `Object.assign`.

```js
// Perform a deep merge with assignment
const partyPreset = assignment({}, defaultSettings, loudPreset)

console.log(partyPreset)
// {
//   power: true,
//   soundSettings: {
//     volume: 100,
//     bass: 20
//   }
// }
//
```

assignment copies over values of all nested objects, which prevents your existing objects from getting mutated.

If you try to change any property in `partyPreset.soundSettings` now, you’ll see that `loudPreset` remains as it was.


```js
partyPreset.soundSettings.bass = 50

// loudPreset doesn't get mutated
console.log(loudPreset)
// {
//   soundSettings {
//     volume: 100
//   }
// }
```

Note: `assignment` is just one of many libraries that help you perform a deep merge. Other libraries, including [lodash.assign](https://lodash.com/docs#assign) and [merge-options](https://www.npmjs.com/package/merge-options)), can help you do it too. Feel free to choose from any of these libraries.

## Should you always use assignment over Object.assign?

As long as you know how to prevent your objects from mutating, you can use `Object.assign`. There’s no harm in using it as long as you know how to use it properly.

However, if you need to assign objects with nested properties, always prefer a deep merge over `Object.assign`.

## Wrapping up

`Object.assign` can be used to prevent objects from mutating.

Take note that `Object.assign` can only prevent direct properties from mutating. If you need to merge objects with nested properties, use `assignment` (or other libraries that do the same thing) instead of `Object.assign`.

## Exercise

1. Combine two objects with `Object.assign`.
2. Combine two objects with `assignment`.
3. Try to mutate your objects. Take note of any mutation you found.
