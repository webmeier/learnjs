# Preventing Arrays from mutating

Most JavaScript sources teach you array methods like `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift` and `splice`. Unfortunately, these five methods mutate your arrays, which is why I recommend you don't use them.

When you learned about arrays in this course, you only learned two methodsâ€“`concat` and `slice`. These two methods allow you to create new arrays without mutating existing ones.

## Array.slice

When you use `Array.slice`, you tell JavaScript which parts of the array you want to **copy** out as your new array.

```js
const newArray = array.slice(startIndex, endIndex)
```

If you omit the `startIndex` and `endIndex` values, you'll get a copy of your array.

```js
const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const arrayCopy = originalArray.slice()
```

When you mutate the copied array, the original array remains the same.

```js
arrayCopy[5] = 6
console.log(originalArray) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(arrayCopy) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

## Array.concat

`Array.concat` lets you combine two arrays together. When you use `Array.concat`, you create a new array immediately, so no mutation occurs.

```js
const firstArray = [1, 2, 3]
const secondArray = [4, 5, 6]
const newArray = firstArray.concat(secondArray)

console.log(firstArray) // [1, 2, 3]
console.log(newArray) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

## Wrapping up

You already know how to prevent arrays from mutating with `slice` and `concat` methods. If you need practice, consider doing the exercises in the [Arrays lesson](../02.js-basics/11.arrays.md) again.
