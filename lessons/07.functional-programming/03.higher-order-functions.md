# Higher order functions

You may hear people tout that in some languages, functions are **first class citizens**. Sometimes, you'll also hear about **higher order functions** in JavaScript.

They're pretty easy to decipher. When you get down to the practical aspects â€“ they both mean the same thing.

## You can pass functions as a variable

That's it.

Remember how in the callbacks lesson, you that you can pass a function to be executed later? Well, that's what **first class citizen** and **higher order function** mean. Nothing more.
