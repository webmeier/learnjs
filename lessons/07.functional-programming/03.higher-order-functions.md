# Higher order functions

You'll probably have heard about **higher order functions** and **functions are first class citizens** when other people talk about Functional Programming in JavaScript.

Forget those buzzwords. They mean one thing:

That's it. You've already done passed functions as variables so many times when you used callbacks in event listeners.

(Sigh. Why do people have to give simple concepts high-and-mighty-sounding-names? ü§∑‚Äç).
