# Destructuring

Normally, when you want to get a value out of an array or object, you have to declare the variables and assign them individually:

```js
// Getting values from arrays
const numbers = [22, 99, 100]
const firstNumber = numbers[0]
const secondNumber = numbers[1]
```

```js
// Getting values from objects
const person = {
  firstName: 'Zell'
  lastName: 'Liew'
}

const firstName = person.firstName
const lastName = person.lastName
```

In ES6, you can **destructure** your variables â€“ a process to declare and assign multiple values from arrays and objects â€“ to get the same effect with just one line of code:

```js
// Destructuring arrays
const [firstNumber, secondNumber] = numbers
```

```js
// Destructuring objects
const {firstName, lastName} = person
```

As you can see, you destructure arrays and objects slightly differently. Let's dive into each of them to understand their nuances.

### Destructuring arrays

To destructure an array, you write the names of the variables you'd like to declare within square brackets (`[]`).

```js
const numbers = [22, 99, 100]
const [firstNumber, secondNumber] = numbers
```

The first destructured variable will always be the first item in the array, the second destructured variable will always be the second item, and so on...

```js
console.log(firstNumber) // 22
console.log(secondNumber) // 99
```

### Destructuring objects

To destructure an object, you write the names of the properties you'd like to declare as variables in curly braces (`{}`).

```js
const awesomePerson = {
  firstName: 'Zell',
  lastName: 'Liew'
}

const {firstName, lastName} = awesomePerson
```

Here, JavaScript assigns `awesomePerson.firstName` to the `firstName` variable and `awesomePerson.lastName` to the `lastName` variable.

```js
console.log(firstName) // Zell
console.log(lastName) // Liew
```

### Destructuring function arguments

If you pass an object or an array as a function argument, you can destructure that object or array too.

```js
const scores = [100, 99, 98]
const firstThree = ([first, second, third]) => {
  return {
    first: first
    second: second
    third: third
  }
}

console.log(firstThree(scores))
// {
//   first: 100,
//   second: 99,
//   third: 98
// }
```

## Using a different variable name for destructured variables.

When you destructure, you're declaring variables at the same time. This means you still need to follow the rules for creating variables. For instance, you can't have two variables with the same name.

```js
const name = 'Zell Liew'
const course = {name: 'Learn JavaScript'}

const { name } = course // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared
```

You can change your destructured variable into a different name with a colon(`:`).

```js
const { name: courseName } = course
console.log(courseName) // Learn JavaScript
```

As much as possible, try not to rename your destructured variable. The syntax looks weird. It feels like you're creating a new object that has the property `name` and a value `courseName` ðŸ™„.

## Default parameters while destructuring

When you destructure a non-existent value, you'll get the undefined.

```js
// You get undefined when you try to destructure a non-existent value in an object
const course = {name: 'Learn JavaScript'}
const { description } = course
console.log(description) // undefined
```

```js
// You also get undefined when you try to destructure a non-existent value in an array
const emojis = ['ðŸ¤¢']
const [firstEmoji, secondEmoji] = emojis

console.log(secondEmoji) // ðŸ˜Ž
```

You can provide a fallback value for each destructured variable if you wish to. To do so, you assign a value to the variable with the `=` sign while you destructure.

```js
// Fallback values for destructured object
const course = {name: 'Learn JavaScript'}
const {
  description = `Most awesome JavaScript course ever!`
} = course

console.log(description) // Most awesome JavaScript course ever!
```

```js
// Fallback values for destructured object
const emojis = ['ðŸ¤¢']
const [firstEmoji, secondEmoji = 'ðŸ˜Ž'] = emojis

console.log(secondEmoji) // ðŸ˜Ž
```

You can rename variables while providing fallback values too. To do so, you combine the two methods mentioned above.

```js
const course = {name: 'Learn JavaScript'}
const {
  courseDescription: description = `Most awesome JavaScript course ever!`
} = course

console.log(description) // Most awesome JavaScript course ever!
```

It does look extremely funky. You probably should refactor your code if you ever need to write funky code like this one.

## Wrapping up

Destructuring gives you a way to extract values out from objects and arrays quickly.

To destructure an array, you use `[]`. The first destructured variable is always the first item in the array, the second destructured variable is the second item in the array, and so on.

To destructure an object, you use `{}`. The destructured variable should be the property name of the object. Optionally, you can rename destructured variables if you wish to.

You can also provide default values to a destructured variable if it doesn't exist.

## Exercise

Perform these actions with the following set of data:

1. Get the first two items in `posts` with destructuring.
2. Get the `id` and `title` of the first post with destructuring.
3. Rename the `title` of the first post to `content` while you destructure.
4. Create a `description` variable and provide it with a default value `Nothing is better than leaving the description empty`.

```js
const posts = [{
  id: 800,
  title: 'This is ðŸ’©'
}, {
  id: 801,
  title: 'Pooing is a natural thing!'
}, {
  id: 802,
  title: 'This is getting irritating'
}]
```
