# Adding (or subtracting) date and time

Date setter methods are often used to add or subtract date and time. If you do a quick google for "how to add a date in JavaScript", you'll see lots of Stack Overflow posts showing this answer: 

```js
const date = new Date(2019, 1, 25)
const threeDaysLater = date.setDate(date.getDate() + 3)

console.log(threeDaysLater) // 28 February 2019
```

Let's break down why this works (and what's bad about this answer). 

## How to use setDate to add days

`setDate` sets the date to a specific value. In the example above, we want to add 3 days to 25 Feb. This means we want to set date to 28.

```js
const date = new Date(2019, 1, 25)
const threeDaysLater = date.setDate(28)

console.log(threeDaysLater) // 28 February 2019
```

Now, if we want `+3 days` to work regardless of the start date, we can't use the number `28`. That's hardcoding. It doesn't work. 

To make `+3 days` work, we need to know the current date, then we add 3 to it. 

```js
const currentDate = date.getDate()
const daysToAdd = 3 
const newDate = currentDate + 3

// Setting the new date 
const threeDaysLater = date.setDate(newDate)
```

If we combine the three steps above, we get this: 

```js
const threeDaysLater = date.setDate(date.getDate() + 3)
```

## What's bad about the setDate method

`setDate` mutates the original date. 

```js
const date = new Date(2019, 1, 25)
const threeDaysLater = date.setDate(date.getDate() + 3)

console.log(date) // 28 February 2019
console.log(threeDaysLater) // 28 February 2019
```

You shouldn't mutate objects. You already learned that in the Best Practices Module. (Revisit the lesson if you need a refresher). 

This doesn't mean you can't use `setDate` (and other setter methods). It means you shouldn't use them *carelessly*. 

## The right way to use setDate

If you want to use `setDate`, make sure you're don't mutate the original date. To do so, you can create a temporary date: 

```js
const date = new Date(2019, 1, 25)
const tempDate = new Date(date)
const threeDaysLater = tempDate.setDate(tempDate.getDate() + 3) 

console.log(date) // 25 February 2019
console.log(threeDaysLater) // 28 February 2019
```

## Alternative methods to add/subtract dates

You can use two other methods to add/subtract date and time. They are: 

1. Create a new date with timestamp 
2. Create a new date with arguments 

Both methods do not mutate the original date. They're also easier to read and understand. Of the two, I prefer the second method. 

### Method 1: Create a new date with timestamp

You'll do this: 

1. Get the current timestamp with `getTime`. 
2. Add (or subtract) the timestamp to get a new timestamp
3. Create a new date with the new timestamp. 

If you use timestamp, you need to be familiar with timestamp math. Here are the values you'll need to know: 

1. **One second**: 1000 milliseconds (`1000`, in timestamp value)
2. **One minute**: 60 seconds (`60 x 1000 = 60000` in timestamp value)
3. **One hour**: 60 minutes (`60x 60 x 1000 = 3600000` in timestamp value)
4. **One day**: 24 hours (`24 x 60 x 60 x 1000 = 86400000` in timestamp value)

Here's the code to add three days: 

```js
const date = new Date(2019, 1, 25)
const timestampForOneDay = 86400000
const threeDaysLater = new Date(date.getTime() + timestampForOneDay * 3)

console.log(threeDaysLater) // 28 February 2019
```

This method does not mutate the original date object 

```js
console.log(date) // 25 February 2019
```

### Method 2: Create a new date with arguments

What I mean by using arguments is to create a new `Date` object with the `year`, `month`, `day`, `hours`, `minute`, `seconds` and `milliseconds` values. (You can omit any values you don't need).

Here's an example to add three days to the original date. 

```js
const date = new Date(2019, 1, 25)
const year = date.getFullYear()
const month = date.getMonth()
const day = date.getDate()

const threeDaysLater = new Date(year, month, day + 3)

console.log(threeDaysLater) // 28 February 2019
```

Notice how this method feels familiar to you already? It feels familiar because you've already created dates with the arguments method for a while. This method is much easier to grasp. 

Likewise, this method does not mutate the original date object 

```js
console.log(date) // 25 February 2019
```

## Calculating Overflow values

Let's say you want to add three days to 28 February. What day would this be? Should it be 2 March (when there's a leap year) or 3 March (when there's no leap year)?

In JavaScript, you don't have to worry about these calculations. If the number you provide to the `Date` constructor is larger than normally acceptable values, JavaScript will calculate the correct date for you automatically.  

```js
const date = new Date(2019, 1, 28) // 28 Feb 2019
const year = date.getFullYear()
const month = date.getMonth()
const day = date.getDate()

// 28 + 3 === 31. 
// JavaScript converts 31 Feb 2019 -> 3 March 2019 automatically
const threeDaysLater = new Date(year, month, day + 3) 

console.log(threeDaysLater) // 3 March 2019
```

The reverse is true. 

```js
const date = new Date(2019, 2, 3) // 3 March 2019
const year = date.getFullYear()
const month = date.getMonth()
const day = date.getDate()

// 3 - 3 === 0. 
// JavaScript converts 0 March 2019 -> 28 February 2019 automatically
const threeDaysEarlier = new Date(year, month, day - 3) 

console.log(threeDaysEarlier) // 28 February 2019
```

This applies to setter methods too. 

```js
const date = new Date(2019, 1, 28)
const tempDate = new Date(date)
const threeDaysLater = tempDate.setDate(tempDate.getDate() + 3) 

console.log(date) // 28 February 2019
console.log(threeDaysLater) // 3 March 2019
```

## Exercise

1. Add 20 days to `28 June 2019` with the timestamp method
2. Subtract 30 days from `28 June 2019` with the timestamp method
3. Add 20 days to `28 June 2019` by creating a new date with arguments. 
4. Subtract 30 days from `28 June 2019` by creating a new date with arguments. 
5. Add 20 days to `28 June 2019` with `setDate`
6. Subtract 30 days from `28 June 2019` with `setDate`
