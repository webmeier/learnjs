# ðŸ”¨ Datepicker: Building the calendar with JavaScript

In this lesson, you'll build the calendar part of the datepicker with JavaScript (so the calendar will work with any month/year combination).

## Building the calendar

We need the calendar to work with any month/year combination. This means we need to use a `Date` object.

```js
const date = new Date()
```

You can use any date you want. For the sake of consistency, we will use February 2019 for this datepicker.

```js
// Remember, month is zero-indexed. 1 means February.
const date = new Date(2019, 1)
```

To build the calendar, we need to get two sections right:

1. The month/year indicator
2. The date-grid

## The Month / Year indicator

Getting the month/year indicator right is easy. Here, you'll need to get the year and month from the date. You already know how to do this from previous lessons.

```js
const monthsInAYear = [
    { shortname: 'Jan', longname: 'January' },
    { shortname: 'Feb', longname: 'February' },
    { shortname: 'Mar', longname: 'March' },
    { shortname: 'Apr', longname: 'April' },
    { shortname: 'May', longname: 'May' },
    { shortname: 'Jun', longname: 'June' },
    { shortname: 'Jul', longname: 'July' },
    { shortname: 'Aug', longname: 'August' },
    { shortname: 'Sep', longname: 'September' },
    { shortname: 'Oct', longname: 'October' },
    { shortname: 'Nov', longname: 'November' },
    { shortname: 'Dec', longname: 'December' }
  ]

const year = date.getFullYear()
const month = date.getMonth()
const monthName = monthsInAYear[].longname
const monthIndicatorText = `${monthName} ${year}`
```

The code for `monthName` is a little difficult to read right now. We can make it easier by writing a function to get the month name.

```js
const getMonthName = (month, style = 'long') => {
  const monthsInAYear = [
    { shortname: 'Jan', longname: 'January' },
    { shortname: 'Feb', longname: 'February' },
    { shortname: 'Mar', longname: 'March' },
    { shortname: 'Apr', longname: 'April' },
    { shortname: 'May', longname: 'May' },
    { shortname: 'Jun', longname: 'June' },
    { shortname: 'Jul', longname: 'July' },
    { shortname: 'Aug', longname: 'August' },
    { shortname: 'Sep', longname: 'September' },
    { shortname: 'Oct', longname: 'October' },
    { shortname: 'Nov', longname: 'November' },
    { shortname: 'Dec', longname: 'December' }
  ]
  const m = monthsInAYear[month]
  if (style === 'long') return m.longname
  return m.shortname
}
```

Using the function:

```js
const monthName = getMonthName(month)
```

The whole code for getting the month indicator becomes:

```js
const year = date.getFullYear()
const month = date.getMonth()
const monthName = getMonthName(month)
const monthIndicatorText = `${monthName} ${year}`
```

Once we have the `monthIndicatorText`, we need to put it into the DOM. To do this, we change the `textContent` of the `<time>` element inside `.datepicker__monthIndicator`.

The HTML looks like this:

```js
<div class="datepicker__monthIndicator">
  <time datetime="2019-02"> February 2019 </time>
</div>
```

So the JavaScript for changing the `textContent` should be this:

```js
const datepicker = document.querySelector('.datepicker')
const monthIndicatorDiv = datepicker.querySelector('.datepicker__monthIndicator')
const monthIndicatorTimeElement = monthIndicatorDiv.firstElementCHild

monthIndicatorTimeElement.textContent = monthIndicatorText
```

We also want to change the `datetime` attribute to match the correct year and month. Here, we can use `setAttribute`.

```js
monthIndicatorTimeElement.setAttribute('datetime', `${year}-${month + 1}`)
```

At this point, you can remove content from the HTML and it'll still be right.

```html
<div class="datepicker__monthIndicator"><time></time></div>
```

## The date grid

To build the date grid, we need to know two things:

1. What's the first day of the month?
2. What's the number of days in the month?

### First day of the month

We need to know what's the first day of the month to position the dates correctly. Getting this is easy. We can use `setDate` to set the date to 1, then use `getDay` to get the day of the week.

Remember to use a new `Date` when you use `setDate`. You don't want to mutate the original `date` object.

```js
const firstDayOfMonth = new Date(date.setDate(1)).getDay()
console.log(firstDayOfMonth) // 5
```

We'll use this value later when we create the grid.

### Number of days in a month

JavaScript helps you calculate the correct date if you provide a value that's outside of a normal calendar range. If you set the `day` argument to 0, you'll get the last day of the previous month. (Why is this so?).

```js
const lastDayOfJanuary = new Date(2019, 1, 0)
console.log(lastDayOfJanuary) // Thu Jan 31 2019
```

To get the number of days in the previous month, we can use `getDate`.

```js
const numDaysInJanuary = lastDayOfJanuary.getDate()
console.log(numDaysInJanuary) // 31
```

To get the number of day sin the current month, we increase the month-number by one:

```js
const year2 = date.getFullYear()
const month2 = date.getMonth()
const lastDayInMonth = new Date(year, month + 1, 0)
const daysInMonth = lastDayInMonth.getDate()
console.log(daysInMonth) // 28
```

Notice we had to use `year2` and `month2` in this code? This is because we already declared and used `year` and `month` previously. This is a sign we should refactor our code (and we'll do it later).

### Building the date buttons

We can use the `daysInMonth` value to create one button for each day of the month. The simplest way to do it is through a `for` loop.

```js
let dategridHTML = ''
for (let day = 1; day < daysInMonth; day++) {
  dategridHTML += `<button>
    <time datetime="${year}-${month + 1}-${day}">${day}</time>
  </button>
  `
}
```

Once we have the HTML for the date grid, we can set it with `innerHTMl`. (We don't have to sanitize the DOM in this case because there's no user-input).

```js
const dategrid = document.querySelector('.datepicker__date-grid')
dategrid.innerHTML = dategridHTML
```

Final step is to remove the inner HTML from `.datepicker__date-grid`.

```html
<div class="datepicker__date-grid"></div>
```

There's one last thing to do: Change the first day of the month with JavaScript.

### Changing the first day of the month with JavaScript

First, we want to remove the CSS that sets the first day of the month to Friday.

```css
/* Remove this CSS */
.datepicker__dates button:first-child {
  grid-column: 6;
}
```

Next, we need to set `grid-column` to the correct value depending on the first day of the Month.

1. `grid-column` for Sunday should be 1
2. `grid-column` for Monday should be 2
2. `grid-column` for Tuesday should be 3
3. `grid-column` for Wednesday should be 4
4. `grid-column` for Thursday should be 5
5. `grid-column` for Friday should be 6
6. `grid-column` for Saturday should be 7

We can do this by setting an inline style on the element. We can either:

1. Set `grid-column` property along with its value
2. Or use CSS variables (We'll do this).

To use CSS variables, we'll first have to decide on the variable name. Let's use `--firstDayOfMonth`. We know JavaScript's `getDay` function returns the following values:

1. Sunday returns 0
2. Monday returns 1
3. Tuesday returns 2
4. Wednesday returns 3
5. Thursday returns 4
6. Friday returns 5
7. Saturday returns 6

This means `--firstDayOfMonth` should be `getDay() + 1`.

We can add `--firstDayOfMonth` when we create `dategridHTML`. Notice how we use a ternary operator to decide whether to add `--firstDayOfMonth` to the HTML.

```js
for (let day = 1; day < daysInMonth; day++) {
  const firstDayStyle = day === 1
	? `--firstDayOfMonth: ${firstDayOfMonth + 1}"`
    : ''


  dategridHTML += `<button style="${firstDayStyle}">
    <time datetime="${year}-${month + 1}-${day}">${day}</time>
  </button>
  `
}
```

We can then use `--firstDayOfMonth` in the CSS like this:

```css
/* Add this CSS */
.datepicker__date-grid button:first-child {
  grid-column: var(--firstDayOfMonth);
}
```

## Testing the calendar

You can test this calendar by changing the year and month values. It should look right no matter which year or month you pass into the initial `date` value.
