# The Date object

What's the date today? 

You can tell the date physically if you have a calendar around you. You can also tell the time if you have a clock. In JavaScript, we can tell the date and time with the `Date` object. 

Here's what it looks like: 

```js
const date = new Date()
```

If you `console.log` date, you'll get a that tells you four things:  

1. The day of the week (like Wednesday) 
2. The date today (like Jan 23 2019) 
3. The time now (like 17:21:13)
4. The timezone offset (like GMT+8000 Singapore Standard Time)

```js
Wed Jan 23 2019 17:21:13 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time)
```

There's more you can do with the Date object. Let's go through them all in the next few lessons.
