# Setting a date with Date methods

Date gives you several methods to set dates and time. 

## Methods to set Date

1. `setFullYear`: Set 4 digit year in Local Time.
2. `setMonth`: Set month of the year in Local Time.
3. `setDate`: Set day of the month in Local Time.

Note: Each method has its UTC equivalent:

1. `setUTCFullYear`: Set 4 digit year in UTC.
2. `setUTCMonth`: Set month of the year in UTC.
3. `setUTCDate`: Set day of the month in UTC.

## Methods to set time

1. `setHours`: Set hours in Local Time
2. `setMinutes`: Set minutes in Local Time
3. `setSeconds`: Set seconds in Local Time
4. `setMilliseconds`: Set milliseconds in Local Time
5. `setTime`: Sets timestamp

Note: Each method (except `setTime`) has their its equivalent too:

1. `setUTCHours`: Set hours in UTC
2. `setUTCMinutes`: Set minutes in UTC
3. `setUTCSeconds`: Set seconds in UTC
4. `setMilliseconds`: Set milliseconds in UTC

## Using the set methods

You can use any method here to change a date. Here's an example where we change the month from November to December. 

```js
const date = new Date(2019, 10)
console.log(date) // 01 Nov 2019 

date.setMonth(11)
console.log(date) // 01 Dec 2019
```

## Exercise

Create a Date object and set it to `23 June 2019` at 8pm Local Time. 

Do the following: 

1. Set minutes to 59. 
2. Set hours to 22. 
3. Set date to 15

`Console.log` the new date at each point. What's this new date. Can you explain why you get that result?
