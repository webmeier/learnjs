# Comparing Dates and times

If you want to compare between dates in JavaScript, you can compare them directly, like this: 

```js
const a = new Date(2019, 0, 27)
const b = new Date(2019, 0, 26)

console.log(b < a) // true
```

The above only works for non-equality comparisons (`>`, `>=`, `<` or `<=`). 

You can't compare two dates with `===` because a Date is a JavaScript object. You can't compare two objects with `===`. (Refer back to [the if/else lesson in Module 2 (JavaScript basics)][1] if you need a refresher). 

```js
const a = new Date(2019, 0, 26)
const b = new Date(2019, 0, 26)

console.log(a === b) // false
```

If you want to check if two dates are exactly the same, you need to create your own function to compare them. One simple way is to compare timestamps. 

```js
const isSameTime = (time1, time2) => {
  return time1.getTime() === time2.getTime()
}

const a = new Date(2019, 0, 26)
const b = new Date(2019, 0, 26)

console.log(a === b) // false
console.log(isSameTime(a, b)) // true
```

Note: `isSameTime` uses `getTime`, and `getTime` returns a timestamp in milliseconds. This means, `isSameTime` works better for comparing between two different times (not date). 

If you want to check if two dates fall on the same day, the best way is to compare their `year`, `month` and `date` values. 

```js
const isSameDay = (date1, date2) => {
  return date1.getFullYear() === date2.getFullYear() && 
    date1.getMonth() === date2.getMonth() &&
    date1.getDate()=== date2.getDate()
}

const a = new Date(2019, 0, 26, 10) // 10am, 26 Jan, 2019
const b = new Date(2019, 0, 26, 12) // 12pm, 26 Jan, 2019
console.log(isSameDay(a,b)) // true
```
