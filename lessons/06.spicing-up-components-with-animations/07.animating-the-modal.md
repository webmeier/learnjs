# ðŸ›  Animating the modal window

By the end of this lesson you should be able to get this:

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/modal/02-complete.gif" alt="Completed animation for the off-canvas menu">
  <figcaption>Completed animation for the off-canvas menu</figcaption>
</figure>

## How to animate the modal window

Remember the modal window is visible (`opacity: 1;`) when open, and invisible (`opacity: 0;`) when closed? Here, all you need to do is animate the `opacity` property and you're done.

```css
.modal-container {
  /* other properties */
  opacity: 0;
  z-index: -1;
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-out;
}
```

Tada! ðŸŽ‰
