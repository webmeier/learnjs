# Greensock Animation API (GSAP)

Greensock Animation API (GSAP) is an animation library that's performs animations incredibly well. It can be used safely back to IE6 to create animations without jank. It is the only animation library that handles SVG animations seamlessly.

Many animation experts, like Sarah Drasner and Chris Gannon, use GSAP on a daily basis in their work. You can use GSAP too.

(Okay, GSAP actually freaking amazing).

You'll learn how to use GSAP in this course for simple animations. Complex animations are out of scope. If you want to learn more about complex animations, I recommend you follow Sarah or Chris for more information. (Alternatively, ask me some questions and I might come back with another course ðŸ˜Ž).

## Installing GSAP

When you use GSAP normally in your project, you need to include the library before you include your JavaScript file. The process looks like this:

```html
<!-- Link to GSAP -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/1.20.3/TweenMax.min.js"></script>

<!-- Your main JavaScript comes nexet -->
<script src="js/main.js"></script>
```

## Installing GSAP with the starter kit

If you use GSAP with the starter template, the installation process is different. Why it is different will become clear to you when you learn about Webpack in a later module. For now, follow the instructions.

To install GSAP, you need to run the following command in the command line, after navigating to your project folder. (You can also use Yarn if you know about Yarn. Don't worry about Yarn otherwise).

```js
npm install gsap --save-dev
```

Once you have installed gsap in your command line, go to your `main.js` file and add `import 'gsap'` at the top of your JavaScript file. With this, you've installed GSAP.

```js
import 'gsap`'
```

## TweenMax and TimelineMax

GSAP provides you with main objects â€“ `TweenLite`, `TweenMax`, `TimelineLite` and `TimelineMax`.

As you can tell from the names, `TweenMax` is a stronger version (with more features) than `TweenLite`. `TimelineMax` is a stronger version (more features) than `TimelineLite`.

Since you're learning, let's use all of GSAP's capabilities. We'll use `TweenMax` and `TimelineMax` primarily in the course.

## What's a Tween?

One single movement in an animation is called a Tween.

You can create a Tween for each

What do I want to say here.

I want to bathe. haha
But let me talk 15 more minutes before I do so.

1 single movement in an animation is called a Tween.

GSAP's Tweenmax gives you the ability to make tweens.

A tween looks like this:

```js
TweenMax.method(element, duration, vars)
```

`method` refers to the GSAP method you'll like to tween with.

`element` is the `element` you want to tween for. If you want to create a tween for multiple elements at once, you can pass in an array of elements. For this course, we'll stick to tweening one thing at a time.

`duration` is the duration of your tween. This duration is an integer in seconds (without the `s` suffix!).

`vars` is an object of the properties you want to animate. More on this later.

## GSAP methods

GSAP provides many methods that are useful. The most useful ones are:

1. `set`
2. `from`
3. `to`

`set` sets the `vars` to the specified values without creating a tween. (No animation if you use `set`).

`from` animates the element from the values you set in `vars` to their current values.

`to` animates the elements from their current values to the values you set in `vars`.

## GSAP vars

GSAP vars is an object that lets you specify what properties you want to animate. You can specify any CSS property here. Just switch the CSS naming format into camel case.

So, for example, if you want to animate the `font-size` property, you change `font-size` into `fontSize`.

```js
const vars = {
  fontSize: '20px',
  backgroundColor: '#40eefa'
}
```

GSAP also lets you animate CSS transforms. The syntax here is slightly different though:

- For `translateX`, you specify the `x` property.
- For `translateY`, you specify the `y` property.
- For `rotate`, you specify the `rotation` property.

```js
const vars = {
  x: 200, // Translates 200px from left to right
  y: -200 // Translates 200px from bottom to top
  rotation: 90 // Rotates 90 degrees
}
```

When you use x, y and rotation, GSAP uses CSS transform matrix to calculate the tween. CSS Transform matrix is unbelievably complicated to understand.

Don't even bother trying to understand it. You won't ever want to calculate CSS transform matrix by hand. I recommend you stick to using GSAP to save time, energy, and most importantly, sanity.

**Is there a documentation that contains all animate-able properties?**

Unfortunately, no. There isn't a documentation that documents the properties that GSAP can animate. The good news is, you won't need such a documenation because GSAP can animate any animate-able CSS property. So, as long as you can transition the CSS property, GSAP can handle it for you.

Besides, you won't want to animate properties other than `transform` and `opacity` as much as possible.

By the way, even though GSAP is super performant, you can't prevent jank from happening if you animate CSS properties other than `transform` and `opacity`.

Don't believe it? See this version of the [janky codepen](https://codepen.io/zellwk/pen/LzqJdJ) built with GSAP and open your eyes to the truth.

## Let's start tweening

Enough talk. Nothing beats examples, so let's start by tweening something. You'll get it immediately once you see it work!

Let's say you have a box. You want to move the box from the left to the right over 2 seconds.

To do so, you use the `to` method because you want to move the box **to** the right. In `vars` object, you specify the `x` property (translateX) to move things horizontally.

```js
const box = document.querySelector('.box')
TweenMax.to(box, 2, {x: 400 })
```

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/tween" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

Now, let's say you want to move the box into it's current position, from the bottom. It should be invisible at first, and it should become fully visible when you reach the end.

To do so, you use the `from` method because you want to move the box **from** the bottom. In `vars` object, you specify the `y` property (translateY) to move things vertically.

```js
const box = document.querySelector('.box')
TweenMax.to(box, 2, {y: -200 })
```

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/tween" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

## Timing functions

Like CSS animations, you can create timing functions for each of your tweens. The syntax is slightly different though.

In GSAP, you place the timing functions as the `ease` property.

```js
const vars = {
  ease: Power0.easeOut;
}
```

GSAP provides you with many global easing variables, including `Power0`, `Power1`, `Power2`, `Power3`, `Power4`, `Back`, `Elastic`, etc. You can find a complete list of all possible variations on [GSAP's Ease visualizer](https://greensock.com/ease-visualizer).

You may think that these variables look weird and overwhelming right now. Don't worry about it. You can always refer to GSAP ease visualizer to help you out. It looks almost exactly like the cubic bezier tool anyway!

There are custom configurations you can choose from.

I don't know what I want to say here, but these are powerful stuff. I want to help people understand what they are.

Power0, Power1, Power2, Power3 and Power4 refers to the degree of the ease, the strength of the ease. If you've checked out Firefox's cubic bezier devtools, tehy kind of mean the same thing.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

After the Power0 to Power4 easing variables, GSAP gives you other variables that cubic-bezier curves cannot create an easing for. An example of such an easing is bounce.

With the `Bounce` variable, you can immediately create a bouncing ball animation without worrying about the easing! Can you see how powerful that is?

Codepen. Use my old basketball thing.

## Customizing your easing

Don't get overwhelmed with GSAP's many possible easing variables. You can always refer to the handy visualizer, play around with the configuration variables and see how the easing looks.

When you create animations and you want them to look good, you need to put in the time to go through the different possible eases and find a good easing.

There's no substitute for experimentation here!

So experiment away!

## Multiple Tweens at the same time

You can Tween an element with two different sets of `vars` at the same time.

```
const box = document.querySelector('box')
TweenMax.to(box, 1, {x: 200})
TweenMax.to(box, 1, {y: 200})
```

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

If you want the second Tween to continue after the first Tween, you need to set a delay value in the second tween with the `delay` property.

```
const box = document.querySelector('box')
TweenMax.to(box, 1, {x: 200})
TweenMax.to(box, 1, {y: 200, delay: 1})
```

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

Setting the delay easy if you only have one or two tweens to work with. More often than not, you don't. You have something much more complex.

And that's where TimelineMax comes in to help.

## Chaining Tweens with TimelineMax

TimelineMax allows you to chain tweens together without you having to write the delay proprerty manually.

To create a Timeline, you write `new TimelineMax({})`. (This `new` thing requires you to know about Object Oriented Programming, which you'll learn in a later module).

```
const tl = new TimelineMax({})
```

Once you've created a timeline, treat the new `tl` variable as `TweenMax` and continue doing whatever you did above.

```
const tl = new TimelineMax({})
tl.to(box, 1, {x: 200})
tl.to(box, 1, {y: 200})
```

What you'll notice is, without the delay, the second tween (moving vertically) automatically gets attached to the end of the first tween. Isn't that sweet?!

</figure>

There's way more to TweenMax and TimelineMax that you've learned in this lesson. As you go build more components, you'll learn how to use more of them if the need arises.

That's it for a basic intro of the Greensock Animation API.

## Exercise

1. Install GSAP into your project.
2. Try creating a tween that moves an object from 200px from the left to the right.
3. Create a tween that moves an object 200px from the top to the bottom.
4. Create a tween that turns an object invisible.
