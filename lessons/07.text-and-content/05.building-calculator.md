# Building a calculator

This is the start of a three-part lesson about building a calculator. By the end of these three lessons, you should get a calculator that functions exactly like an iPhone calculator (without the `+/-` and percentage functionalities).

Here's what you'll get:

I urge you to sit down and try building the calculator yourself before following the lesson. It's a good practice.

A word of warningâ€”don't take the calculator lightly; it may seem simple at first, but you need to take care of many edge cases. When I tried to build the calculator, I had to redo it three times because I underestimated its complexity.

With that, let's begin by understanding how a calculator works.

## How a calculator works

What can possibly happen when a person gets hold of a calculator?

A few things can happen:

1. They hit a number key (0-9)
2. They hit an operator key (+, -, &times;, Ã·)
3. They hit the decimal key
4. They hit the equal key
5. They hit the clear key

Immediately, you have five branches of `if/else` statements. It can be overwhelming to consider everything at once, so let's take it step by step and consider what a normal person would do when they pick up a calculator.

## A normal flow

Let's call this normal person Mary.

When Mary picks up a calculator, she'll probably hit a number key.

### Hitting a number key

At this point, if the calculator shows 0 (the default number), the target number should replace zero.

If the calculator shows a non-zero number, the target number should be appended to the displayed number.

</figure>

At this point, Mary can hit any of the following keys:

1. A decimal key
2. An operator key
3. The clear key

Let's say Mary hits a decimal key.

### Hitting the decimal key

When Mary hits the decimal key, a decimal should appear on the display. If Mary hits any number after hitting a decimal key, the number should be appended on the display as well.

Next, being sensible, Mary may hit any of the following key:

1. A number
2. An operator key
3. The clear key

Let's say Mary hits an operator key

### Hitting an operator key

If Mary hits an operator key, the operator should be highlighted so Mary knows the operator is active.

</figure>

Once Mary has hit an operator key, if she is sensible, she'll hit a number key.

### Hitting a number key

When Mary hits a number key, the previous display should be replaced with the new number. The operator key should also release it's pressed state.

</figure>

Let's say Mary decides to complete her calculation by hitting the equal key next.

### Hitting the equal key

When Mary hits the equal key, the calculator should calculate a result, depending on the initial value entered before the operator, the operator, and the final value that's currently displayed.

Once a result is calculated, the result should replace the value on the display.

## Let's take pause and build the above flow

(Note: I'm working on this part of the lesson. I wanted to publish the above for you to try out first ðŸ˜„.)

In part 2, you'll learn about the edge cases, and have another chance to build the calculator again.

In part 3, you'll see how you to build the calculator, step by step.
