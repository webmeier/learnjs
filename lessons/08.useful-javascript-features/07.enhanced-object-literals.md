# Enhanced Object Literals

ES6 gives you JavaScript objects three enhancements. These enhancements are collectively called Enhanced Object literals. These enhancements are:

1. Property value shorthands
2. Method shorthands
3. The ability to use computed property names

## Property value shorthands

When you create objects, you may assign variables to properties that have the same name.

```js
const fullName = 'Zell Liew'

const Zell = {
  fullName: fullName
}
```

**Property value shorthands** lets you omit the assignment part (`: fullName`) if your property name and variable name are the same.


```js
const fullName = 'Zell Liew'

const Zell = {
  fullName
}

// Underneath the hood, Javascript does this:
const Zell = {
  fullName: fullName
}
```

## Method shorthands

When you declare a method, you need to write a function expression, like this:

```js
const Zell = {
  sayMyName: function () { console.log("I'm Zell") }
}
```

**Method shorthands** lets you omit the `: function` part.

```js
const Zell = {
  sayMyName () { console.log("I'm Zell") }
}
```

## Computed object property names

If you need to create a property name through a variable, you had to use the bracket notation:

```js
const property = 'name'
obj[property] = 'Zell'
```

**Computed object property names** lets you create objects with variables as property keys. To do so, you wrap the property with square brackets.

```js
const property = 'name'
const person = {
  [property]:'Zell'
}

console.log(person.name) // Zell
```

You can even change the property name while creating it.

```js
const property = 'name'
const person = {
  [property]: 'Zell',
  ['full' + property]: 'Zell Liew'
}

console.log(person.fullname) // Zell Liew
```

## Exercise

1. Create a property with property value shorthands
2. Create a method with method shorthands
3. Add two dynamic variables into Javascript with computed property names
