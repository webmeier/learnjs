# Useful array methods

JavaScript contains useful methods that can help you manipulate arrays. You'll learn four of them in this lesson. They are:

1. `findIndex`
2. `find`
3. `filter`
4. `map`

## findIndex

`findIndex` lets you **find the index of an item** in an array. It loops through every item in the array and **returns the first** truthy expression.

The syntax looks like this:

```js
const index = array.findIndex((currentItem, index) => {
  // return a truthy expression here
})
```

Its much easier to explain Array.findIndex with an example, so let's do that. Let's say you have an array of objects. Each object is a person, and each person has a name.

```js
const people = [
  {name: 'Zell'},
  {name: 'Vincy'},
  {name: 'Casper'}
]
```

You want to know the position of the person named `Casper` in the `people` array. To do so, you can use `Array.findIndex` and check if the `name` property in each object matches `Casper`.

```js
const casperIndex = people.findIndex(person => person.name === 'Casper')
console.log(casperIndex) // 2
```

## find

`find` works the same way as `findIndex`, but `find` returns the item instead of the index.

```js
const casper = people.findIndex(person => person.name === 'Casper')
console.log(casper) // {name: 'Casper'}
```

## filter

`array.filter` returns a new array that contains a **subset of the original array**. Items will be added to the new if you return a truthy expression.

```js
const filteredItems = array.filter((currentItem, index) => {
  // return a truthy expression to include in filteredItems
})
```

Once again, its easier to explain `filter` with an example, so let's do that.

Let's say you have a list of numbers. You want to get make another list of numbers that are bigger than ten. You can do this easily with `filter`.

```js
const numbers = [1, 12, 4, 18, 9, 7, 11, 3, 50, 5, 6]
const biggerThan10 = numbers.filter(num => {
  if (num > 10) return true
})

console.log(biggerThan10) // [12, 18, 11, 50]
```

To shorten the code slightly, you can return the `if` condition because a truthy expression evaluates to `true`.

```js
const numbers = [1, 12, 4, 18, 9, 7, 11, 3, 50, 5, 6]
const biggerThan10 = numbers.filter(num => num > 10)
```

## map

`map` returns a new array that contains the **same number of items** in the original array. Each item in the new array item is the value you return in the callback.

```js
const newArray = Array.map((currentItem, index) => {
  // return the transformed value
})
```

Once again, its easier to explain `Array.map` with an example, so let's do that.

Let's say you have a list of numbers. You want to create a new array that contains another list of numbers, but each item is multiplied by five.

```js
const numbers = [1, 12, 4, 18, 9, 7, 11, 3, 50, 5, 6]
const multipliedBy5 = numbers.map(num => {
  return num * 5
})

console.log(multipliedBy5) // [5, 60, 20, 90, 45, 35, 55, 15, 250, 25, 30]
```

Since there's only one line of code, you can use an implicit return:

```js
const numbers = [1, 12, 4, 18, 9, 7, 11, 3, 50, 5, 6]
const multipliedBy5 = numbers.map(num => num * 5)
```

`map` is super versatile. It can be used to simplify arrays or even modify other types of values.

### Modifying an array value

Let's say you have an array of todos. You want to add the string `I need to` in front of each todo item.

```js
const todos = ['buy eggs', 'feed my cat', 'water plants']

// What you want:
// [
//   'I need to buy eggs',
//   'I need to feed my cat',
//   'I need to water plants',
// ]
```

```js
const todoStrings = todos.map(todo => return 'I need to ' + todo)

console.log(todoStrings)
// [
//   'I need to buy eggs',
//   'I need to feed my cat',
//   'I need to water plants',
// ]
```

### Simplifying arrays with map

Let's say you have an array of objects. Each object contains a person's first and last name.

```js
const people = [{
  firstName: 'Zell',
  lastName, 'Liew'
}, {
  firstName: 'Vincy',
  lastName: 'Zhang'
}]
```

From this list of people, you need to get an array of firstNames. To get this array, you can use `map` to loop through the array and return `person.firstName`.

```js
const firstNames = people.map(person => person.firstName)
console.log(firstNames) // ['Zell', 'Vincy']
```

### map vs forEach

Many people get confused between `map` and `forEach`. Here's a quick way to remember what does what:

1. Use `map` when you want to return a new array
2. Use `forEach` when you want to do stuff.

## Chaining array methods

Since `map` and `filter` return arrays, you can perform another `map` or `filter` method immediately if you wish to.

For example, let's say you want have a list of numbers. You want to multiply each number by five. After the multiplication, you want to get a list of numbers that are between 30 and 40.

Here's how you might do it now.

```js
const numbers = [1, 12, 4, 18, 9, 7, 11, 3, 50, 5, 6]
const multipliedBy5 = numbers.map(num => num * 5)
const between30And40 = multipliedBy5.filter(num => num >= 30 && num <= 40)
```

If you chain array methods, you can do this:

```js
const result = numbers.map(num => num * 5)
  .filter(num => num >= 30 && num <= 40)
```

## Exercise

Try completing these exercises with the following set of data:

1. Find the index of `Thomas Edison`.
2. Find the object that contains `Winston Churchill`.
3. Create an array that contains people that died before 1940.
4. Create an array that contains people that are alive between 1850 and 1900.
5. Create an array that contains the `firstName`, `lastName` and `yearsLived` for each person (where `yearsLived` is the number of years tho person lived).
6. Get the total number of `yearsLived` of the people who were alive between 1750 and 1900.

```js
const people = [
  { firstName: 'Benjamin', lastName: 'Franklin', yearBorn: 1706, yearOfDeath: 1790 },
  { firstName: 'Thomas', lastName: 'Edison', yearBorn: 1847, yearOfDeath: 1931 },
  { firstName: 'Franklin', lastName: 'Roosevelt', yearBorn: 1882, yearOfDeath: 1945 },
  { firstName: 'Napolean', lastName: 'Bonaparte', yearBorn: 1830, yearOfDeath: 1821 },
  { firstName: 'Abraham', lastName: 'Lincoln', yearBorn: 1809, yearOfDeath: 1865 },
  { firstName: 'Mahatma', lastName: 'Gandhi', yearBorn: 1869, yearOfDeath: 1948 },
  { firstName: 'Winston', lastName: 'Churchill', yearBorn: 1874, yearOfDeath: 1965 },
  { firstName: 'Charles', lastName: 'Darwin', yearBorn: 1809, yearOfDeath: 1882 },
  { firstName: 'Albert', lastName: 'Einstein', yearBorn: 1879, yearOfDeath: 1955 },
  { firstName: 'Pablo', lastName: 'Picasso', yearBorn: 1881, yearOfDeath: 1973 },
  { firstName: 'Ludwig', lastName: 'Beethoven', yearBorn: 1770, yearOfDeath: 1827 },
  { firstName: 'Walt', lastName: 'Disney', yearBorn: 1901, yearOfDeath: 1966 },
  { firstName: 'Henry', lastName: 'Ford', yearBorn: 1863, yearOfDeath: 1947 },
  { firstName: 'Steve', lastName: 'Jobs', yearBorn: 1955, yearOfDeath: 2012 }
]
```
