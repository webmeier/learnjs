# Template Literals

**Template literals** (or template strings) are strings that begin and end with backticks.

```js
const templateLiteral = `This is a template literal`
```

## It's easy to log variables with template literals

Let's say you have a function, `sayName` that logs the first name and last name of a person.

To split the `firstName` and `lastName` variables up, what you've done so far is concatenate an empty string between the two variables.

```js
const sayName => (firstName, lastName) {
  console.log(firstName + ' ' + lastName)
}

sayName('Zell', 'Liew') // Zell Liew
```

This is clunky. You can skip the clunky string concatenation process by using template literals.

To do so, you wrap code with `${}`. Anything within `${}` in a template literal signifies JavaScript; anything outside `${}` signifies a normal string.

```js
const sayName => (firstName, lastName) {
  console.log(`${firstName} ${lastName}`)
}

sayName('Zell', 'Liew') // Zell Liew
```

## Multi-line strings

Template literals let you create strings that span multiple lines, like this:

```js
const multi = `One upon a time,
In a land far far away,
there lived a witch,
who could change night into day`
```

## Exercise

1. `console.log` a string that contains a variable with template literals
2. `console.log` a string that spans multiple lines with template literals
