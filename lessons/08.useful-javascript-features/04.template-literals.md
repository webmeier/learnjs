# Template Literals

**Template literals** (or template strings) are strings that begin and end with backticks, like this:

```js
const templateLiteral = `This is a template literal`
```

## Writing variables within template literals

Let's say you have a function, `sayName` that logs the first name and last name of a person.

To split the `firstName` and `lastName` variables up, what you've done so far is to concatenate an empty string between the two variables.

```js
function sayName (firstName, lastName) {
  console.log(firstName + ' ' + lastName)
}

sayName('Zell', 'Liew') // Zell Liew
```

In template literals, you can skip this clunky string concatenation process by writing code within the `${}` syntax.

Code written within `${}` behave like normal Javascript. Anything outside `${}` are normal strings.

```js
function sayName (firstName, lastName, teamName) {
  console.log(`${firstName} ${lastName}`)
}

sayName('Zell', 'Liew') // Zell Liew
```

Note: The space between `firstName` and `lastName` is a normal string.

## Multi-line strings

Template literals lets you create strings that span multiple lines, like this:

```js
const multi = `One upon a time,
In a land far far away,
there lived a witch,
who could change night into day`
```

</figure>

## Wrapping up

Template literals make it super easy for you to create strings that contain variables and strings that span multiple lines.

Template literals also bring about another feature – tags – that you've not learned yet. You can find out more about tags if you like over at [this article](http://wesbos.com/tagged-template-literals/). I've never found a real use case for it yet.

## Exercise

1. `console.log` a string that contains a variable with template literals
2. `console.log` a string that spans multiple lines with template literals
