# Returning objects with implicit return

You make arrow functions perform an implicit return if you follow two rules:

1. You write only one line of code in the function
2. That line of code is not enclosed in curly braces (`{}`)

The second rule can be relaxed a little if you want to return an object.

Here's how you would return an object if you did not use implicit returns.

```js
const functionName = _ => {
  return {
    prop: 'value'
  }
}
```

To return objects with an implicit return, you can wrap your object within parenthesis.

```js
const functionName = _ => ({prop: 'value'})
```

## Exercise

1. Create an arrow function that uses implicit returns to return an object.
