# Returning objects in arrow functions

You learned that implicit returns in arrow functions require two requirements:

1. You write only one line of code in the function
2. That line of code is not enclosed in curly braces (`{}`)

If you want to return a new object, what you can do with these rules is the following:

```js
const functionName = _ => {
  return {
    prop: 'value'
  }
}
```

You can return implicit objects if you wish to. To do so, you need to wrap the object inside a parenthesis.

```js
const functionName = _ => ({prop: 'value'})
```
