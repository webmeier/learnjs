# Looping through objects

You may need to loop through objects once in a while. The best way is to convert objects into arrays first, then loop through the converted array.

You can use `Object.keys`, `Object.values` or `Object.entries` to do so.

## Object.keys

Key is another word for property. `Object.keys` creates an array that contains the properties of an object.

```js
const properties = Object.keys(object)
```

Here's an example:

```js
const fruits = {
  apple: 28,
  orange: 17,
  pear: 54,
}

const keys = Object.keys(fruits)
console.log(keys) // [apple, orange, pear]
```

You can loop through `keys` like a normal array.

```js
// Looping through keys with for...of
for (const prop in keys) {
  console.log(prop)
}

// Results of the console.log
// apple
// orange
// pear
```

## Object.values

`Object.values` creates an array that contains the values of every property in an object.

```js
const values = Object.values(object)
```

Here's an example:

```js
const fruits = {
  apple: 28,
  orange: 17,
  pear: 54,
}

const values = Object.values(fruits)
console.log(values) // [28, 17, 54]
```

## Object.entries

`Object.entries` creates an array of entries. Each entry is an array that contains a property and its value.

```js
const values = Object.entries(object)
```

Here's an example:

```js
const fruits = {
  apple: 28,
  orange: 17,
  pear: 54,
}

const entries = Object.entries(fruits)
console.log(entries)
// [
//   [apple, 28],
//   [orange, 17],
//   [pear, 54]
// ]
```

It can be useful to destructure each entry when you loop through `entries`.

```js
for (const [fruit, count] of entries) {
  // do something here
}
```

## Exercise

1. Loop through an array created with `Object.keys`
2. Loop through an array created with `Object.values`
3. Loop through an array created with `Object.entries`
