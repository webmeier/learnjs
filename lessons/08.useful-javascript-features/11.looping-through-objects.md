# Looping through objects

Once in a while, you may need to loop through Objects in JavaScript. The best way to loop through objects is **first to convert the object into an array. Then, you loop through the array.**

You can convert an object into an array with three methods:

1. `Object.keys`
2. `Object.values`
3. `Object.entries`

## Object.keys

`Object.keys` creates an array that contains the properties of an object. Here's an example.

```js
const fruits = {
  apple: 28,
  orange: 17,
  pear: 54,
}

const keys = Object.keys(fruits)
console.log(keys) // [apple, orange, pear]
```

## Object.values

`Object.values` creates an array that contains the values of every property in an object. Here's an example:

```js
const fruits = {
  apple: 28,
  orange: 17,
  pear: 54,
}

const values = Object.values(fruits)
console.log(values) // [28, 17, 54]
```

## Object.entries

`Object.entries` creates an array of arrays. Each inner array has two item. The first item is the property; the second item is the value.

Here's an example:

```js
const fruits = {
  apple: 28,
  orange: 17,
  pear: 54,
}

const entries = Object.entries(fruits)
console.log(entries)
// [
//   [apple, 28],
//   [orange, 17],
//   [pear, 54]
// ]
```

My favorite of the three is `Object.entries` because you get both the key and property values.

## Looping through the converted array

Once you've converted the object into an array with `Object.keys`, `Object.values`, or `Object.entries`, you can loop through it as if it was a normal array.

```js
// Looping through arrays created from Object.keys
const keys = Object.keys(fruits)
for (const key of keys) {
  console.log(keys)
}

// Results:
// apple
// orange
// pear
```

If you use `Object.entries` you might want to [destructure](/blog/es6) the array into its key and property.

```js
for (const [fruit, count] of entries) {
  console.log(`There are ${count} ${fruit}s`)
}

// Result
// There are 28 apples
// There are 17 oranges
// There are 54 pears
```

## Exercise

1. Loop through an array created with `Object.keys`
2. Loop through an array created with `Object.values`
3. Loop through an array created with `Object.entries`
