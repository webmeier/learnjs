## How to animate the modal window

Last module, you learned the modal window needs to appear over the main content when it is visible.

  <figcaption>Modal window appears over main content when it is visible</figcaption>
</figure>

You also learned it needs to go below the main content when it is invisible.

<figure>

  <figcaption>Modal window appears below main content when it's invisible</figcaption>
</figure>

To animate the modal window, you need to change two CSS properties â€“ `opacity` and `z-index`. It's quite tricky if you're doing it the first time, so follow along.

## Changing the opacity

When you create the animation for the first time, you'll be tempted to change the `opacity` (the property that controls whether the modal is visible or invisible).

```css
.modal-container {
  /* other properties */
  opacity: 0;
  z-index: -1;
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-out;
}
```

When you open up the modal window, the transition looks perfect. The modal window covers the button.

  <img src="../../images/components/modal/02-perfect-open.gif" alt="The opening animation looks perfect">
  <figcaption>The opening animation looks perfect</figcaption>
</figure>

But it's not perfect. If you look closely at the modal window, you'll notice that the toggle button appears unnaturally, before the modal window begins to fade away.

<figure>
  <img src="../../images/components/modal/02-wonky-close.gif" alt="The toggle button appears before the modal window begins to fade away">
  <figcaption>The toggle button appears before the modal window begins to fade away</figcaption>
</figure>

Admittedly, you're not seeing the most obvious example, since both the button and the modal window are the same color.

With a slight change in color, the unnatural transition becomes obvious immediately.



Why is this so?

This happens because the `z-index` property changes before the `opacity` property. If you have a background on the `.modal-container`, this jarring change becomes even obvious.

What to do?

You need to transition the `z-index` property as well.

## Transitioning the z-index

Transitioning the `z-index` property is where it gets mind-boggling. You need to transition the `z-index` differently when the modal opens and closes. Pay very close attention.

When the modal window closes, you want to delay the `z-index` from switching (z-index switches instantly, but it can be delayed) with `transition-delay`. It looks like this in your code:

```css
.modal-container {
  /* other properties */
  opacity: 0;
  z-index: -1;
  transition-property: opacity, z-index;
  transition-duration: 0.3s, 0s;
  transition-timing-function: ease-out;
  transition-delay: 0s, 0.3s;
}
```

Or this, if you prefer the shorthand, which is easier to read and understand:

```css
.modal-container {
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-out,
              z-index 0s 0.3s linear;
}
```

With this piece of code, the opening animation for the modal looks wonky, but the closing animation looks great.

<figure>
   <img src="../../images/components/modal/02-wonky-open.gif" alt="">
   <figcaption></figcaption>
 </figure>

The opening animation gets screwed up because we delayed changing the `z-index` property when opening up the modal.

To fix this, you need to set `transitio-delay` to `0s` when the modal opens up. You can do this within the `.modal-is-open .modal-container` selector.

```css
.modal-is-open .modal-container {
  /* other properties */
  opacity: 1;
  z-index: 1;
  transition-delay: 0s;
}
```

And the transition would be great again.
