Form submission (can put errors right before submit button)
Dig deeper into aria-role? Not often used I think.
Error handling for form fields ðŸ˜­. 1) provide error message at bottom 2) provide error hints for each error. Add aria-labelled ya for this password hint (pg 284) 3) mark invalid with aria-invalid
