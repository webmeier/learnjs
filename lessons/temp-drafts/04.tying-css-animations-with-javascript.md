# Integrating CSS transitions and animations with JavaScript

When you create a transition or animation, sometimes you want to follow up with a change in the JavaScript. These cases are rare, but it's good to know that you can use these.

(Note: Only add these in if I build and need them. So, this will take a temp shutdown for now).

Sometimes, you want to tell when a transition or animation ends in JavaScript. To do so, you can use the `transitionend` event or the `animationend` event.

## Transitionend

document.addEventListener('transitionend', e => {
  console.log(e)

  propertyName: "background-color"
  target: <button class="button test">
})

One property by one property. Can check for target. Rarely used, but good to know it exists.

## Animationend

// end of transition
document.addEventListener('animationend', e => {
  if (e.animationName === 'wave') {
    e.target.style.animationPlayState = 'paused'
  }
})

// end of animation
document.addEventListener('animationend', e => {
  if (e.animationName === 'wave') {
    e.target.style.animationPlayState = 'paused'
  }
})
