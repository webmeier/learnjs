# What is AJAX

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It is commonly used as a term to signify getting (and sending) data to a server, waiting for a response, and updating the site without navigating a user away from the current page.

## XML

XML stands for Extensible markup language. We used it to send information between browsers and servers in the past. XML is rarely used now. In its place, we use another format called JSON.

You'll learn more about JSON in the next lesson.

### Other types of data

We can pass other types of data besides JSON. Some examples are:

1. ArrayBuffer
2. Blob
3. formData
4. Text

For this course, we will only use JSON. You can learn about the rest on your own later.

## XMLHttpRequest

We use a method called `XMLHttpRequest` to send and retrieve data in the earliest forms of AJAX. `XMLHttpRequest` request (also called XHR for short) was difficult to use, so people build libraries to help us with it. One example of a library is jQuery; it contains an `ajax` method.

Today, we have a second method called the Fetch API. Fetch is easier to use compared to XHR, but [as I wrote in a CSS Tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/using-fetch/), Fetch is still pretty difficult to use for real-life situations.

For this course, we'll use the a library called Axios to help us perform AJAX.
