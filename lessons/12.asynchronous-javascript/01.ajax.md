# What is AJAX

1. AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.
  1. XML stands for Extensible markup language
  2. It was used to pass information from servers to browsers.
  3. Today, we no longer use XML.
  4. We use another format called JSON.
  5. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
  6. Looks like a JavaScript object.
  7. We'll learn more about JSON in the next lesson
  8. But we still call it AJAX because we're so used to AJAX.
2. XMLHttpRequest
  1. In the earliest forms of AJAX, we used an method called XMLHttpRequest to send and retrieve data from servers.
  2. It was quite difficult to use
  3. So people built libraries to make it easier
  4. One example was jQuery
  5. You can use AJAX with jQuery.ajax
  6. Now, there's an easier method to get started with AJAX. It's called the Fetch.
  7. We'll learn about the Fetch API in a later lesson.
3. Callbacks, Promises and Async/await
  1. When we write asynchoronous JavaScript, we always use callbacks.
  2. You have done so with event listeners already.
  3. There are newer improvements called Promises in ES6 and Async/await in ES8?
  4. You'll also learn about Promises and Async/await in this module.
