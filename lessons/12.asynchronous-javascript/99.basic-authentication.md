# Basic Authentication

Basic authentication
Why authenticate

base-64 encoded ASCII string from a "string" of binary data.
btoa

```js
const request = new XMLHttpRequest()
request.addEventListener('load', e => {
  console.log(e.target)
})
request.open('get', link)
request.setRequestHeader('Authorization', 'Basic ' + btoa('zellwk:lwkeat88'))
request.send()
```

Note: `setRequestHeader` must be after `open` and before `send`.

```js
fetch(link, {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Basic ${btoa('zellwk:lwkeat88')}`
  }
  // body: JSON.stringify({
  //   name: 'New Repository',
  //   description: 'Repository created to test out Posting to Github'
  // })
})
  .then(r => {
    console.log(r)
    return r.json()
  })
  .then(d => {
    console.log(d)
  })
```

There's two type of API structures in today's coding environment.

The first type is a REST API. REST stands for representational state transfer. It is a set of rules developers follow when they create their API.

The second type is a Graph API. Graph APIs are built on GraphQL, a structure proposed by Facebook.

Today, most API use the REST architecture. Few APIs use GraphQL. I expect GrahpQL to become the dominant API structure in 3-5 years, so I'm going to teach you how to use them too.

We'll cover REST first. Then, GrahpQL in a later module.
