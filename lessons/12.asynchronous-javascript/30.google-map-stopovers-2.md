# üõ†Ô∏è Google Maps Clone: Removing waypoints

Users may want to remove waypoints when they're using the UI. We should let them do it. 

Here's how it'll look: 

<figure>
¬† <img src="/images/2018/" alt="">
¬† <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

When they remove a waypoint, we need to remove: 

1. The search box itself 
2. The dropdown for the accompanying Autocomplete Widget

## The HTML 

First, we'll add a delete button to each search box. The HTML of our search boxes become: 

```js

```

We also have to add a delete button to each search box that's created by via JavaScript. 

```js

```

ANd the styles? Fuck, the styles should already be in the CSS. So I'm not going to write about it maybe? Maybe should write. 

We'll show the close button when a user hovers over the search box. 

```js

```

Note: The CSS is already done for you. 

## Removing the search boxes 

We can have many close buttons. This means we should use an event delegation pattern. 

```js
const searchBoxParent = document.querySelector('.controls__body')
searchBoxParent.addEventListener('click', evt => {
  // Remove search box
})
```

We should only remove the search box if the close button was clicked. We'll do nothing if anything else got clicked. 

```js
searchBoxParent.addEventListener('click', evt => {
  if (!evt.target.classList.contains('searchBox__close') return 
})
```

If the search box is clicked, we need to remove the search box itself. The search box has a class of `.controls__input`. So we can find the closest ancestor with this class. And remove it. 

```js

```

We also need to remove the accompanying Autocompete dropdown. We need the `index` of the searchbox to know which Autocomplete dropdown to remove. 

```js

```

## Homework 

Add listeners to remove waypoints. Remember to: 

1. Remove the search box when a user clicks the close button
2. Remove the accompanying Autocomplete dropdown
