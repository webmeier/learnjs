4. Massage the data
  1. What comes in the next step, after fetching a piece of data is called data massaging. This means we want to convert the fetched data into an object we'd like to use. Which means we filter out things that are not important.
  2. Let's go through an example
  3. Say you want a list of repositories I starred.
  4. To do so, you need to dive into the data itself
  5. Search for the thing
  6. Filter it.
  7. If you want to reduce the information further, you might want to run a map function to create a new array.
  8. Like this
  9. Finally, when you have the array, you can act on it.
  10. If you want write this list to the document, you can use the methods you learned before. Whatever methods they are! Muahaha
