# Authencitation with Oauth

When to use Oauth: when you are creating an application
When you need Oauth because you cannot do basic authentication

What is Oauth
  1. It's a spec
  2. Convert username/password into a computer generated token

Two kinds of Oauth tokens:
1. Personal access tokens https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Programmatically generated tokens

Must read documentation because each Oauth is structured differently, but there is a common thread. They need the following strcture.

Then Example with Github. We'll see more examples as we authenticate with Twitter in the component building part.

Need to access Oauth api with Basic authentication

// Personal / Oauth App tokens. Personal means your own token. Oauth App tokens means an app's token. (This is for Github).

// For twitter.... need to check!
// Maybe check for Instagram too...
// Creating an app that uses Oauth to login... this will be another topic altogether. This will touch on Oauth App tokens.

Github Oauth — https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorization-options-for-oauth-apps/#directing-users-to-review-their-access — not sure yet. Maybe can do Oauth, but not the application style Oauth.
Instagram Oauth https://www.instagram.com/developer/authentication/ — Cannot use Instagram. Can only use it for Graph API going forward.

https://github.com/settings/tokens

Creating personal token with Github => Do that method of going to https://github.com/settings/tokens. THen show the token. Copy this token, paste it inside the header, under `Authorization: 'Bearer token`

Twitter... require SSL endpoints. So that's kinda going to be difficult to explain...

OAuth is an authentication protocol that allows users to approve an application to act on their behalf without sharing their password.

Twitter Oauth https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/overview/application-only

Signing in with Twitter: https://dev.twitter.com/web/sign-in/implementing

Login with Twitter / Github, etc flow requirements =>
1. Need server to handle callback url. Then log in with your user through the backend. Something we cannot perform simply with a simple frontend based course like Learn JavaScript.

Generate SSL Cert first...
