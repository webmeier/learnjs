# JSON

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is used as the de-facto method to transfer information between browsers and servers through AJAX.

A JSON object looks like a JavaScript object. The major difference is JSON can only contain strings. Key and value pairs are wrapped with double quotes.

```json
{
  "firstName": "Zell",
  "lastName": "Liew",
  "occupation": "developer",
  "age": "30"
}
```

## Converting JavaScript to JSON

We can convert a JavaScript object to a JSON object with `JSON.stringify`.

Let's go through an example. Say we have a `macbook` object.

```js
const macbook = {
  operatingSystem: 'macOS Sierra',
  screenResolution: '2880x1800',
  usbPorts: 2
}
```

To convert to JSON, we use `JSON.stringify`.

```js
const jsonMac = JSON.stringify(macbook)
```

If you log `jsonMac` into the console, you'll see a string.

## Converting JSON to JavaScript

To convert JSON to JavaScript, you can use `JSON.parse`.

```js
const jsMac = JSON.parse(jsonMac)
```

If you log `jsMac` into the console, you'll see a JavaScript object.

</figure>

You'll see more examples of `JSON.parse` later in later lessons.

Note: You won't be converting to (and from) JSON much in this course because we'll be using Axios. Axios converts JavaScript objects to JSON for you automatically.
