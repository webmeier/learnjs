# Possible data types

JSON is one of the many types of data we can use. There are other types of data as well.

## XHR supports the following data types

1. Array Buffer
2. Blob
3. Document
4. JSON
5. Text

## Fetch supports the following data types

1. Array Buffer
2. Array Buffer View
3. Blob
4. String (which can mean text or JSON)
5. URLSearchParams
6. Form Data

Fetch gives you methods to transform different data types into readable JavaScript. These methods make it easier to work with Fetch.

Here are some examples:

1. Convert Array buffers with `arrayBuffer()`
2. Convert Blobs with `blob()`
3. Convert JSON with `json()`
4. Convert Text with `text()`
5. Convert form data with `formData()`

Don't worry about different types of data at this point. We will go through them in detail when you need them.

## Exercise

Nothing required. For this lesson, you only need to know that there are other data types besides JSON.
