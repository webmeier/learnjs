# Dealing with blank search fields

Ok,,,,,, so need to deal with this too. But probably add an error message here because there's no way to search... Plus if they give an empty space there's no way to search too, so an error will occur. Will have to catch this error and make it readable. The question is how? :)

Shall explore!





We don't to draw directions if the user doesn't fill both search fields. We simply cant! 

To prevent users from leaving an empty field, we can add a `required` attribute to the input. 

```html
<input ... required/>
```

If the user submits the form with an empty field, our browser will kick in and tell users to fill up the form. 

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2018/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

The `required` attribute doesn't make it fool-proof though. If users decide to leave a spacebar in the field, the error message from browsers don't kick in.

It's better to rely on JavaScript to prevent such cases. When this happens, we can throw an error and handle it ourselves. 

For now, since we're still buliding the UI, we don't want to care about error handling yet. But we'll add a todo note and a error message for ourselves to remind us to fix this later. 

```js
form.addEventListener('submit', evt => {
  evt.preventDefault()

  const origin = searchFields[0].value.trim()
  const destination = searchFields[1].value.trim()

  // Todo: Show error messages in the UI
  if (!origin) throw Error('Please enter a starting location')
  if (!destination) throw Error('Please enter a destination')

  // ...
})
```
