# Fetching with Axios

Axios is a library that helps us perform AJAX operations easily. It is used by many developers worldwide.

## Installing Axios

You need to include the Axios library before your JavaScript file. The process looks like this:

```html
<!-- Link to Axios -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>

<!-- Your main JavaScript comes next -->
<script src="js/main.js"></script>
```

## Fetching with Axios

To fetch means to go out and bring something back. If you throw a tennis ball out, you can get your dog to fetch the tennis ball back to you.

Fetching information with Axios is similar. You'll need pass in a location—a link—to ask browsers to fetch information from.

```js
axios.get('url')
```

This link you're trying to fetch must be a valid API link. An API stands for Application programming interface. It is a set of rules that allow programs to talk to each other.

If the link you try to fetch isn't a valid API link, you'll get an error that says "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource."

```js
axios.get('https://google.com')
```

If you fetched a valid API link, you won't get any errors. You'll just see nothing in the console.

```js
axios.get('https://api.github.com/users/zellwk/repos')
```

The url above tells Axios to fetch a list of my Github repositories. We need to write a `then` statement to see the information Axios fetched for us.

```js
axios.get('https://api.github.com/users/zellwk/repos')
  .then(response => console.log(response))
```

The info we want can be found in the `data` key.

```js
axios.get('https://api.github.com/users/zellwk/repos')
  .then(response => console.log(response.data))
```

## Handling the data

`data` is an array of 30 items. Each item is a JavaScript object that contains information about a Github repository.

There's so much information that it hurts. We probably don't need these much information. The first step to handling the data, then, is to reduce the information to the ones you need.

Let's say we want to display a list of my repositories in the DOM. To do so, we only need three pieces of information:

1. `name`—name of the repo
2. `html_url`—link to the repo
3. `stargazer_count`—number of people who starred the repo

One thing we can do is use `map` to create a new array that contains only information we need.

```js
axios.get('https://api.github.com/users/zellwk/repos')
  .then(response => {
    const data = response.data.map(repo => {
      return {
        name: repo.name,
        url: repo['html_url'],
        stars: repo['stargazers_count']
      }
    })
  })
```

Then, we can display the data in the DOM. One way is through `innerHTML`.

```js
const ol = document.querySelector('ol')

ol.innerHTML = data.map(repo =>
  `<li><a href="${repo.url}">${repo.name} (${repo.stars} stars)</a></li>`
)
  .join('')
```

## Rate Limits

Rate limits prevent servers from crashing by limiting the number of requests you can make to a server. The limit can change depending on whether you're logged in (authenticated) or not.

For Github, you can send 60 unauthenticated requests and 5000 authenticated requests every hour.

If you hit the rate limit, you'll get an error. The only way to fix this error is to wait till your rate limit refreshes. (In short, try again later).

## Pagination

Some APIs send you paginated responses. Github does this too. The request we sent above only retrieves 30 repositories. If you want to retrieve more repositories, we'll need to change the request (or ask for a second page).

## Wrapping up

Axios is a library that lets us perform AJAX operations. Axios will not act on information it retrieves from the server immediately. To perform an action, you need to write a callback within a `then` method.

This `then` method comes from JavaScript promises. To understand AJAX with Axios properly, you need to understand what promises are.

## Exercise

1. Use Axios to fetch a list of my repositories from Github.
2. Create an array of repositories that have more than 50 stars.
3. Display the list of repositories in the DOM
