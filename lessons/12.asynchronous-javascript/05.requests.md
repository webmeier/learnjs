# The anatomy of a request

A request is the information you a server to ask for information. A response is the information the server sends back to you.

The type of request sent to the server (and subsequently, the response you receive from the server) depends on the API structure. Today, most API follow the REST structure.

**REST** stands for representational state transfer. Simply put, it is a set of rules developers follow when they create their API. One of these rules states that you should be able to get a piece of data (also called a resource) when you link to a specific URL.

For this lesson, you'll learn how to send a request under the REST architecture.

## The anatomy of a request

A request consist of four parts:

1. The endpoint
2. The method
3. The data (or body)
4. The headers

### The endpoint

The endpoint is the URL you send a request to. It is made up of three things:

1. The root endpoint
2. The path
3. Query parameters

```
root-endpoint/path?params
```

The **root-endpoint** is the starting point of the API you’re requesting from. The root-endpoint of Github’s API is `https://api.github.com`.

The **path** determines what you request for. For example, to get a user's repositories from Github, you will need to use `https://api.github.com/users/:username/repo`.

Here, `:username` is a variable. You can replace it with your Github username to fetch a list of your repositories.

**Query parameters** lets you modify the request you sent. They begin with a question mark at the end of the path. Each query parameter is a key-value pair, separated by an ampersand.

```
?query1=value1&query2=value2
```

If you want to get a list of my repositories that is sorted by push date, you can set the `sort` parameter to `pushed`.

```
https://api.github.com/users/zellwk/repos?sort=pushed
```

### The method

You can send five different kinds of requests:

1. GET—used to get (or read) information
2. POST—used to create new pieces of information
3. PUT—used to update information
4. Patch—used to update information too
5. Delete—used to delete information.

The API documentations will tell you which method to use. For example, you can use a `get` request to get a list of a user's repositories; you can use a `post` request to [create a new repository](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#create).

To specify a method, you pass a second variable (an object) to Fetch. The method defaults to `get` if its not specified.

```js
fetch('some-url', {
  method: 'post'
})
```

### The Data

The data (also called body or message) contains information you want to send to the server. It is only used with `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` or `DELETE` requests.

If you want to send JSON information, make sure you convert JavaScript to JSON with `JSON.stringify` first.

```js
fetch('some-url', {
  method: 'post',
  body: JSON.stringify(aJavaScriptObject)
})
```

### Headers

Headers are used to provide additional information to the server. Some common examples are for authentication, caching, and providing information about the body content. You can find a list of valid headers on MDN’s [HTTP Headers Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers).

In Fetch, `headers` is an object. You set headers the same way you create a JavaScript object. Each header information is a key-value pair.

To send JSON data to the server, you need to set `content-type` to `application/json`.

```js
fetch('some-url', {
  method: 'post',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
  body: JSON.stringify(aJavaScriptObject)
})
```
