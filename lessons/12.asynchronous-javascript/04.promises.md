# Intro to JavaScript Promises

"Do you promise to buy a black forest cake for my birthday next week?", your daughter asks.

"Yeah, I promise", you say.

Promises in JavaScript are similar to promises in real life—we don't know if the promise will be fulfilled when it is made. In JavaScript, a promise is an object that will return a value in future.

## How a promise works

If we write the promise between you and your daughter in the above scenario in JavaScript, it'll look like this:

```js
const promise = buyCake('black forest')
```

At this point, we don't know if the promise will be fulfilled. We only know the promise is made. In JavaScript, we say the promise is **pending**.

```js
console.log(promise)
```

### Fulfilling a promise

When you show up to your daughter's birthday with a black forest birthday cake, you fulfilled your promise to her. In JavaScript, we say the promise is **fulfilled** or **resolved.**

When a promise is resolved, you can carry out the next set of instructions within a `then` method. `then` takes in a callback.

Note: because promises have a `then` method, some people also call promises **thenables** (then-able).

```js
buyCake('black forest')
  .then(celebrateBirthday)
```

The callback in each `then` method gives you one argument only. You'll see how it works when we learn to construct a promise together in a later lesson.

### Rejecting a promise

If you did not show up with a black forest birthday cake in hand, the promise is not fulfilled. In JavaScript, we say the promise is **rejected**.

When a promise is rejected, you perform a contingency plan in a `catch` method.

```js
buyCake('black forest')
  .then(celebrateBirthday)
  .catch(postponeCelebration)
```

## Constructing a promise

You can construct a promise by writing `new Promise`. Each promise is a function takes in two values—`resolve` and `reject`.

Note: you'll rarely construct a promise. Learn this section as background info to understand how a promise works underneath the hood.

```js
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  /* Do something here */
})
```

`resolve` and `reject` are functions that take in one value each. If `resolve` is called, the promise succeeds and goes into the next `then` method. If `reject` is called, the promise fails and goes into the `catch` method.

This means you need a condition to determine if a promise resolves or rejects.

```js
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  if (condition) {
    resolve('😁')
  } else {
    reject('😢')
  }
})
```

```js
// This version below is written with ternary operators
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  condition ? resolve('😁') : reject('😢')
})
```

In the real life example above, you need to show up to the birthday party with a black forest cake. This then be used as a condition for the promise.

```js
const buyCake = cakeType => {
  return new Promise (resolve, reject => {
    cakeType === 'black forest')
      ? resolve('😁')
      : reject('😢')
  })
}
```

If you pass `black forest` into `buyCake`, the promise fulfills and the `then` callback gets called.

```js
buyCake('black forest')
  .then(reaction => console.log(reaction)) // 😁
  .catch(reaction => console.log(reaction)) // Skipped
```

If you pass something else into `buyCake`, the promise rejects and the `catch` callback gets called.

```js
buyCake('pikachu cake')
  .then(reaction => console.log(reaction)) // Skipped
  .catch(reaction => console.log(reaction)) // 😢
```

Of course, the `buyCake` promise we built together in this example is a simple one. We can resolve or reject the promise immediately without waiting for an actual response.

An example of a real promise is Fetch.

## Fetch and promises

Fetch is built on promises. You can clearly see that Fetch is a promise if you `console.log` it into the console.

```js
const promise = fetch('https://api.github.com')
console.log(promise)
```

When a response is successfully retrieved from the server, Fetch resolves into the `then` method. Here's how a response from Fetch looks like:

```js
fetch('https://api.github.com')
  .then(response => console.log(response))
```

</figure>

The response from Fetch is pretty weird—it doesn't contain the data we wanted. The data is actually hidden in the `body` property as a `ReadableStream` (which can be confusing, yes).

All you need to know now is—We need to convert the `ReadableStream` to the data we need. For Github's case, we need to convert the `ReadableStream` with the `json` method.

```js
fetch('https://api.github.com')
  .then(response => {
    const data = response.json()
    console.log(data)
  })
```

At this point, if you log `data`, you'll see that `data` is another promise. We need to wait for it to fulfill once again.

```js
fetch('https://api.github.com')
  .then(response => {
    response.json()
      .then(data => console.log(data))
  })
```

### Chained then calls

All promises have a `then` method. If you return a promise in another promise, you can continue the chain with `then`. The above code can be rewritten as:

```js
fetch('https://api.github.com')
  .then(response => {
    return response.json()
  })
  .then(data => console.log(data))
```

We can shorten the above slightly with an implicit return that comes with arrow functions:

```js
fetch('https://api.github.com')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
```

That's how you use Fetch (on a basic level).

2. What happens when a promise resolves?
3. What happens when a promise rejects?
4. Why can you chain multiple `then` methods?
