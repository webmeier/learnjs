# Fetching with Axios

Axios is a library that helps us perform AJAX operations easily. It is used by many developers worldwide.

Fetch based adaptor: https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/1219

## Installing Axios

You need to include the Axios library before your JavaScript file. The process looks like this:

```html
<!-- Link to Axios -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>

<!-- Your main JavaScript comes next -->
<script src="js/main.js"></script>
```

## Fetching with Axios

To fetch means to go out and bring something back. If you throw a tennis ball out, you can get your dog to fetch the tennis ball back to you.

Fetching information with Axios is similar. You need to tell Axios what information you need through a url.

```js
axios.get('url')
```

Once you pass the url into Axios, Axios initiates a **request**—information sent to the url to ask for more information in return.

The url you pass to Axios must link to a valid API. An API stands for Application programming interface. It is a set of rules that allow programs to talk to each other.

If your link is not valid, you'll get an error that says "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource."

```js
axios.get('https://google.com')
```

</figure>

If your link is valid, you won't get any errors. You'll just see nothing in the console.

```js
axios.get('https://api.github.com/users/zellwk/repos')
```

To see the response from the server, you need to write a `then` statement.

```js
axios.get('https://api.github.com/users/zellwk/repos')
  .then(response => console.log(response))
```

The information you want (ofter called resource or payload) can be found in the `data` property.

```js
axios.get('https://api.github.com/users/zellwk/repos')
  .then(response => console.log(response.data))
```

## Handling the data

The url we used above tells Axios to fetch 30 repositories from my Github account. You can see that `data` is an array of 30 items. Each item is a JavaScript object that contains information about a repo.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2018/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

Let's say we want to display the 30 repositories in the DOM. We want the eventual HTML to look like this:

```html
<ol>
  <li><a href="link-to-repo1">Name of repo1 (# of stars)</a></li>
  <li><a href="link-to-repo2">Name of repo2 (# of stars)</a></li>
  <li><a href="link-to-repo3">Name of repo3 (# of stars)</a></li>
  <li><a href="link-to-repo4">Name of repo4 (# of stars)</a></li>
</ol>
```

To do so, we first need to extract the information to the ones we need. From the above HTML, we can see we need three pieces of information:

1. `name`—name of the repo
2. `html_url`—link to the repo
3. `stargazer_count`—number of people who starred the repo

We can create a new array with `map` that contains the information we need.

```js
axios.get('https://api.github.com/users/zellwk/repos')
  .then(response => {
    const data = response.data.map(repo => {
      return {
        name: repo.name,
        url: repo['html_url'],
        stars: repo['stargazers_count']
      }
    })

    console.log(data)
  })
```

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2018/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

Once we have the array, we need to create a HTML string that contains all list items.

```js
const htmlString = data.map(repo =>
  `<li><a href="${repo.url}">${repo.name} (${repo.stars} stars)</a></li>`
).join('')
```

Finally, we can create an `ol` element, change it's `innerHTML`, and append it to the DOM.

```js
const ol = document.createElement('ol')
ol.innerHTML = htmlString
document.body.appendChild(ol)
```

## Rate Limits

If you send more than 60 requests to Github in an hour, you'll run into an error that says "Request failed with status 403".

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2018/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

This error is due to a rate limit. Rate limits prevent servers from crashing by limiting the number of requests developers can send to the server.

This limit can change depending on whether you're authenticated (fancy word that means logged in). For example, Github allows you to send 60 unauthenticated requests and 5000 authenticated requests.

The only way to "fix" an error due to rate limits is wait till your limit refreshes. (In short, try again later).

## Wrapping up

Axios is a library that lets us perform AJAX operations. Axios will not act on information it retrieves from the server immediately. To perform an action, you need to write a callback within a `then` method.

This `then` method comes from JavaScript promises. To understand AJAX with Axios properly, you need to understand what promises are.

## Exercise

1. Use Axios to fetch a list of my repositories from Github.
2. Create an array of repositories that have more than 50 stars.
3. Display this list of repositories in the DOM
