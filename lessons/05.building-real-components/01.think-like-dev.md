# How to think like a developer

Does your mind blank out when you try to build real things? I'm talking about real things you'll use, like accordions, sliders and modal windows. The anxiety sets in, and you stare at your blank text editor in horror.

Let's face it. You're afraid. You're scared you'll write shitty code that others would despise you for. You're scared of feeling stupid, so much that you'd rather not start, than face the possibility for you're an idiot, and you've been faking it all along.

You face **coder's block**.

## Coder's block is a myth

It's like writer's block. It's something you've conjured up in your mind to stop you from doing something that will possibly scar you for life. It's there to protect you (at least, that's what your brain tells you).

## Breaking out of coder's block

Luckily, overcoming coder's block is simple. Follow these four steps and you'll be fine.

They are:

1. Break down the problem into small problems
2. Find solutions to your small problems
3. Assemble the solutions
4. Refactor and improve

### Step 1: Break down the problem into smaller problems

How do you put an elephant into the fridge?

Here's what most people would answer:

1. Open the fridge
2. Put the elephant in
3. Close the fridge

Problem solved.

</figure>

This answer explains why you get stuck whet you face a blank JavaScript file. **It skips steps**. It tries to do too many things at once.

If you think logically about the question, so many problems remain unanswered! Here are a few I've conjured up:

1. What fridge are we talking about?
2. What kind of elephant are we talking about?
3. If the elephant is too huge to fit into the fridge, what do you do?
4. Where do you find the elephant in the first place?
5. How do you transport the elephant to your fridge?

Big problems are hard to tackle. It's normal to get paralyzed when you face a big one. To break yourself out of paralysis, you need to break your problems down into smaller problems.

Think about it this way. Which is easier? "Run for 5km" vs "wear your running clothes and shoes and walk out of your house".

I bet the later seems more doable.

Don't worry about the "correctness" or "size" of your small problems. Just break it down as much as you can for now. Write them all down.

If you're still paralyzed, grab this [JavaScript Roadmap](https://jsroadmap.com) course that I've created for you. It's free. In there, I show you how to overcome any fear, confusion, overwhelm or paralysis as you work through JavaScript.

### Step 2: Find solutions to your small problems

Once you've written your small problems down, pick any one of them and start trying to solve them. Be as detailed as possible at this point. If you can code, code.

For example:

1. What fridge? â€“ the fridge that sits in your kitchen
2. What kind of elephant? â€“ the [african bush elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_elephant)
3. What if the elephant is too big? â€“ Get a shrink gun (ðŸ”«) to shrink the elephant (ðŸ˜Ž).
4. Where do you find the elephant? â€“ Africa
5. How do you transport the elephant? â€“ Put it in your bag after you've shrunk it, then take a plane back home.

As you're solving your problem, you may become paralyzed again. This happens when your problem is still too large to be solved immediately. To combat the paralysis, you know the drill. You need to break it down into even smaller problems.

In the example above, answers #3 and #4 are still too vague. So, let's break it down further and get some answers.

1. Where do you get the shrink gun? â€“ Borrow from the mad scientist next door.
2. Where in Africa can you find the elephant? â€“ Addo Elephant Park in South Africa.

Once you have the answers to all your small problems, you've effectively solved the big problem. What's left is to piece them together so your solution works.

### Step 3: Assemble the solutions

So, in the put-elephant-in-fridge example, you can probably follow the following steps:

1. Get a shrink gun from the scientist next door
2. Fly to South Africa
3. Travel to Addo Elephant Park
4. Find an elephant in the park
5. Shoot the elephant with the shrink gun
6. Put the shrunk elephant in your bag
7. Travel back to the airport
8. Fly back to your country
9. Travel to your house
10. Put the elephant in your fridge

Problem solved. Sounds logical, yeah?

As interesting as the elephant example sounds, you probably won't be flying to Africa to capture elephants anytime soon. This is why hands-on video lessons are starting in the next lesson.

You'll get some practice breaking down simple problems, thinking through how to solve them, and how to piece the solutions together.

As you put your solutions together, don't worry about code quality at this point. Quality isn't important right now. Throw that thought out, or risk getting paralyzed again.

### Step 4. Refactor and improve

The final step is to refactor your solution and improve your code.

This step may not come to you naturally. It takes effort and practice before you can tell how you can improve your code. Don't beat yourself up if you feel your code is messy. It does the job well enough, at least for now. Leave it, celebrate. You've done well.

After celebrating, start working on a new problem. Do so for a few more runs and you may begin to notice small irritating things that trip you up over and over. Here's where you begin to improve your code.

Start tweaking once you see this. Go back to your old code. Think about how you can improve it and begin refactoring. You may still feel uneasy about the code though. That uneasy feeling will remain with you for a long time. I still have it. I don't know if it'll ever disappear, and I think it won't. But this uneasy feeling is good, because you intuitively realize something can be improved, and you'll be able to come back and make things better down the road.

## Thinking like a developer is simple

Don't worry about the quality of the code. If you don't mind writing shitty code, you won't have problems with your blank screen. Everyone starts somewhere. I started by writing ðŸ’© too.

Break down your problems, find solutions and assemble them. That's the nature of code. It either works or it doesn't. Once it works, it works.

Don't worry about improving your code right now. You most likely won't be able to do it. Come back in a week, two weeks or a month, after you've built a few more things. And you'll magically see what you need to do.

Over and out. Now, time to get your hands and brain dirty!
