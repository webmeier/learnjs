# Before you begin making components

You will finally be building real components from the next lesson onwards. Are you excited yet?

If you want to thoroughly understand the components you're going to build, you want to follow these instructions.

**First, break the problem down yourself**. What needs to happen? What do you have to write in your CSS? Your JavaScript? Writing down the steps on paper/in your text editor before moving to the next step. It helps clarify your mind, so you know what to focus on to get the job done.

**Second, create the HTML, CSS and JavaScript**. Try your best here. Take 1/2 hour to do this at most. Don't worry if it doesn't work out, or if it doesn't look nice. Focus on the crucial CSS and JavaScript interaction you need go get the component working.

If you do this, you'll have a general idea of what needs to happen, which would help you understand and remember the lesson as soon as you read it.

**Third, code along with the lesson**.

You'll find the starting HTML and CSS for each component you're going to build in the Github repository. Look under the `components/component-name/01.starter` for each component you want to build.

Make sure you type every line of code you see. Doing so helps you [remember the process](https://zellwk.com/blog/remember/) so you know how to build the component again when you face yet another blank screen.
