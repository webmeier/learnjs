# Using the starter template

If you look at the Github repo, under `/components/`, you'll see a `_starter-template` folder. This folder contains a starter template that I've built for you for this course. I call it Simple Starter Template (SST for short).

This SST uses the latest developer tooling approaches – including Gulp and Webpack – to update your website automatically when you save your HTML, CSS or JavaScript files. This SST helps you speed up development tremendously – there's no longer a need for you to save, alt-tab to your browser and hit refresh before you see your updated changes!

## Using the SST

The updated instructions are written directly on the `README.md` file of the SST. Take a look at it and play around with the SST before building your components. I promise it'll be a lot of fun!

Here's what you'll want to test out:

1. Download the SST onto your computer
2. Install Node if you haven't already (instructions in the SST).
3. Spin up the server (instructions in the SST).
4. Edit the `src/index.html` file and see changes updated immediately!
5. Edit the `src/scss/styles.scss` file and see changes updated immediately!
6. Edit the `src/js/main.js` file and see changes updated immediately! (Note: you will need to manually reload the page if you change an event handler. See the SST `README.md` file for more details).

Once you've gotten these 6 things to work, you're set to have a fun time developing components. See you in the next lesson!
