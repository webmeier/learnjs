# ðŸ›  Building a carousel

Although I highly recommend against Carousels, you still run into situations where you need to build them, so learning how to do so is useful. HA!

So anyway, let me start by talking briefly about what it needs to go into building a carousel. I am a little nervious about thin because I haven't been writing a lot recently, and the thing is I kind of hate communicating in the community. Too many people without any real benefits to me.

I can help benefit others though, but I came to the realization that, even though things can be quite similar, there are always nuances in your own company that you need to iron out yourself. There are no alternatives out of it.

I hate to say this, but it seems like the community isn't that big of a help to me too. Rather, well, even though I got some help, I got more conused too.

But it's a good thing I learned somethngi.

let me go back and start talking about the old stuff again.

The what's important for the carousel.

Wow, so I went one big round and in the end I didn't start on carousels ðŸ˜‚ lol. But okay anyway, it,s time to start on carousels now.

I hate carousels. Carousels are a bitch. They're proven to be low on conversions, so if you're a web designer/if you care a hoot about marketing, you wouldn't want to use a carousel.

But unfortunately, bosses love them, and sometimes, you can't convince them otherwise, so you gotta learn to make them.

:(

And that's why I'm teaching it to you here.

It's also good because carousels are like the semi-complex components where we can really seep into slightly more advanced topics like functional and object oriented programming.

So anyways, that's the start of it all.

Ha.
I'm thinking about random stuff again and I want to have sex so so so badly right now that everything in my mind is just boobs and asses and pussies. Oh man, I'm standing just thinking about it.

I gotta say, it's pretty sweet to be able to write these things out!

So, carousels right, this is how a carousel look like. You're going to build this carousel that looks like this in the lesson today.

Remember to get thae starter file from the folder which I cannot rememeber. Maybe /carousels/01.starter or something. To be copied for sure, I know,

## Anatomy of a carousel

So, let's talk about what a carousel is.

Carousel are a group of large pictures. Their placement may vary sometimes. Sometimes, they are commonly placed on top of each other. Other times, they're placed side by side.

Depending on how they're placed, you'll have a different way to animate them. We're not going to concern ourselves with animating this lesson, you're going to learn to di it in the next one on carousel.s

So the idea really, is, whe nyou click aon a carousel control, the image changes. What you can do now is to hide the image with display: none; and show the image with display block;

There are three control elements in a carousel that you should be aware of:

1. The left button
2. The right button
3. The navigation

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

When a user clicks on the left button, the carousel should switch to the previous image. When the carousel is at the first image, the left button should be hidden so people don't click on it again.

When a user clicks on the right button, the carousel should switch to the next image. If the carousel is at the last image, the right button should be hidden so people don't click on it again.

(Some carousels allow you to click on the right button to arrive at the first image. I highly recommend against doing this because there's a UX problem in there. It's hard for people to visualize things that go in a loop).

When a user clicks on the navigation at the bottom, the carousel should switch to the item the user clicked on.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

(Previous image, Next image, image 1, image 2, image3, etc).

Since the carousel is a list of images, it makes sense to put them in a `<ul>` element like this.

```html
<div class="carousel">
  <ul class="carousel__slides">
    <li class="slide"> ... </li>
    <li class="slide"> ... </li>
    <li class="slide"> ... </li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

Need to set time aside to chat with Quinn regarding carousel. Set aside now, so let's continue the convo so far.

You also need to put the controls into the carousel. One way to do this is this:

```html
<div class="carousel">
  <ul class="carousel__slides"> ... </ul>

  <div class="carousel__controls">
    <button>Left</button>
    <button>Right</button>
    <div class="carousel__nav">
      <button>Image 1</button>
      <button>Image 2</button>
      <button>Image 3</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

OH god. I cannot remember what I'm supposed to say next. I still remember the nice feeling in my dick. I think I'm going to watch a bit more porn related stuff and get meself excited when I'm done with the draft. So so so good!

But anyway, once youh ave the carousel, you need to style it.

## Styling the carousel

Carousel images are usually controlled and added as a background images, so you need to add your background images to the HTML directly. There is no way to dynamically add things to the CSS.

```
```

Then, to make sure the image filss the space, you need to set background-size to cover. You can optionally move your backgound arauond with background pos, but usually its set to center center.

Because its set to the background, you also need to give a height for your carousel. This determines the height for the carousel.

Nah, let's not talk about progressive enhancement and leading first. So let's add a height to each image.

```
```

Next, you want to place the controls ON the image. AS you have learned in the modal-window lesson, that mean you need to place the controls as a separately layer.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

But this is slightly more complicated because you don't want the controls layer to cover the images, or you won't be able to click on the images and links within.

So, what happens is you place the controls layer on the same level as the images, but elevate the buttons to a higher z-index

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

Need more pics lol. This one will be hard to make, but well, let's see what happens yup.

That's for the styling.

## ADding event listeners.

I'm wondering if I should create more event listers section higher upfront, but this seems like a good place too.

Cos earlier, you already know that you need to provide event listeners for three things â€“ the elet button, the ligtn button and the navigation.

Let's add the JavaScript classes and get the elements first

```
```

When you click on the left button, you want to go to the previous slide. When you click on the right button, you want to go to the next slide. When you click on the navigation, you want to go to a specific slide.

Let's create these placeholders too. The functions are going to be called previousSlide, nextSlide and goToSlide respectively.

```
```

## Building the nextSlide functionality

When you click on the button, you want to go to the next slide. What does that entail? Take a minute and think about it before looking at the answer. Better yet, if you can code it up.

So, you need to know what is the current slide in order to know what is the next slide, yes? Then, when you find the next slide, you want to update the UI, changing the active image and controls.

So, in short, heres' what you'll do:

1. Find the current slide
2. Find the next slide
3. Update UI

To be honest, if you think about the other two functionalities these look awefully similar too, don't they?

To get the previous slide, you need to...

1. Find the current slide
2. Find the previous slide
3. Update UI

To go to a specific slide, you need to:

1. Find the current slide
2. Find the target slide
3. Update UI

### Finding the current slide

I don't want to put it upfront nad say you need to think about all of these things right from the groud up, so let me just say find the next slide first.

To find the current slide, you can check and see which element is active now. There are two places â€“ the navigational element or the slide number. Each one is fine. How you check is up to you. You need to update them all anyway.

For this component, let's say you want to use the navigation to check.

Uh okay, you can use the component to check and then find the active class. Moans one thing must be active at any point in time, so you can add it to your HTML first.

Then, find the is-active class.

In the previous lesson, you learned that there are two ways to get the correct slide.

1. With index of slide
2. With href
ASking about links or buttons now, will get back to this. So let's leave it here for now.

This time round, let's use the right index! (You can use href too, actually, so what am I thinking? maybe you should really use href? Hm I wonder).
