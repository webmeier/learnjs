## Lessons from the building process

You've built five components–an off-canvas menu, a modal window, an accordion, a tabbed interface and a carousel.

That's a great start!

Let's take a pause and notice some important lessons before continuing.

## Lesson #1: You need to know HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the three arms of web development. You need to know all three to be a great web developer.

If you're weak in CSS, you might want to spend half an hour everyday to learn CSS. If you want to learn CSS, the best way is to create things. Pick anything and try to make it.

When you can build anything you see with CSS (and when you know what you can't do with CSS), your JavaScript learning process will skyrocket—you'll know when and how to use JavaScript.

If you have any CSS questions. Don't hesitate to ask them in the JavaScript Fundamentals Slack group. We're here to help each other out.

### What if I don't have time? Should I stop learning JavaScript and start learning CSS?

Focus on JavaScript if you can't find the extra half-hour each day to learn CSS.

If you learn something halfway and stop, you wouldn't internalize what's important, which means to say you'll forget it if you don't use it for a while.

You don't want to forget JavaScript, right?

Besides, you'll learn the necessary CSS skills to build components in this course. Once you're done learning JavaScript, you can work on your CSS again.

## Lesson #2: Write your HTML and CSS first before JavaScript

You give yourself a chance to see how a component works best if you stick to writing HTML and CSS. You can mock JavaScript functionality (like adding `is-open` class) manually without writing a single line of JavaScript.

Once you're done with mocking, adding JavaScript becomes an easy process—you know what to change, you know where to change it.

Always write HTML and CSS before JavaScript.

## Lesson 3: Minimize changes

Introduce minimal JavaScript changes. Try to stick to one, at most two class change if you can.

## Lesson 4: Don't worry about code quality

Don't worry about code quality when you build your component for the first time. Your code will suck. I guarantee it.

Once you're done creating the component, take some time to refactor your code. You'll learn a lot about organizing code through this process.

## What have you learned so far?

Did you get more confident with JavaScript? Have you managed to use what you learned to build new things? Did you get any aha-moments from going through this course?
