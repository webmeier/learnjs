# ðŸ›  Building accordions

In this lesson, you'll learn to build accordions. Accordions are components that excel at progressive disclosure. It allows you to show only the important content at a glance. The details of each piece of content is hidden away until you click on it.

Accordions look like this:

Before continuing, make sure you grab the starter files in the Github repo, under `components/03.accordion/01.starter`.

## How to build the accordion â€“ the general idea

When accordions are closed, only their header is revealed. You don't see anything else.

  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

When accordions open up, their content gets revealed.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

Is the accordion content hiding behind the header? Is the accordion just invisible in the same location? You can't tell right now. You need to look at the accordion's animation before you can make a decision. We'll look at animations in a later chapter. For now, let's say the accordion disappears entirely.

**But accordions can by tricky.**

By themselves, an accordion is simple. But accordions don't come alone. They always come in a bunch. This means you need to be able to find the correct content to reveal.

So, in short, to build an accordion, you need to:

1. Add event listeners to show and hide the accordions.
2. Make sure the correct content gets revealed when you click on the accordion header.

Let's get started.

## Building the accordion

From the above section, you know you need to find the accordion content from the accordion title. To do this, you can stack the accordion content and header as siblings in your HTML. When you do so, you can wrap the accordion content and header in a `.accordion` div.

```html
<div class="accordion">
  <div class="accrdion__header">...</div>
  <div class="accrdion__content">...</div>
</div>
```

You'll probably expect what I'm going to say here if you've already built the the off-canvas menu and the modal window.

Before moving on, you want to think about how to open up your accordion. Ideally, you'll want to use one class say the accordion is open. Everything else should be contingent on this class. In the case of our accordions, we have the perfect place â€“ the `.accordion` div.

Let's call this class `.is-open`.

```html
<!-- Opening the accordion -->
<div class="accordion is-open"> ...</div>
```

But wait. Why `is-open` and not `accordion-is-open` like what we did with the off-canvas menu and the modal window?

In the both the off-canvas menu and modal window components, we added the opening class (`offcanvas-is-open` or `modal-is-open`) to the `<body>` element. When you add classes to the body element (or any ancestor element), you want to make sure the class is specific enough. If you add `is-open` to the `<body>`, you can't tell what is opened. The off-canvas menu? The modal? Something else? However, if you add `is-open` to `.accordion`, it's pretty obvious you're opening the accordion itself. Must edit anyway

When the accordion is closed, you want to hide the content. To make it simple for now, let's set the display property to `none`.

When the accordion is closed, you can show the content by setting the display property to something other than `none`. In this case, I styled the accordion with CSS grid, so let's set the display to `grid`.

```css
.accordion {
  display: none;
  /* other properties */
}

.accordion.is-open {
  display: grid;
}
```

Try adding the `is-open` class to a single accordion and you should the accordion content showing up.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

In addition showing and hiding the content, you also need to change the indicator icon from a plus to a minus. The plus and minus icons used in the starter file are SVGs, as you can see:

```html
<div class="accordion__indicator">
  <svg class="indicator__plus" viewBox="0 0 80 80"><use xlink:href="images/sprite.svg#plus"/></svg>
  <svg class="indicator__minus" viewBox="0 0 80 80"><use xlink:href="images/sprite.svg#minus"/></svg>
</div>
```

Here, you want to hide the minus icon and show the plus icon when the accordion is closed. You want to hide the plus icon and show the minus icon when the accordion is open.

```css
.indicator__plus {
  display: block;
}

.indicator__minus {
  display: none;
}

.accordion.is-open .indicator__plus {
    display: none;
}

.accordion.is-open  .indicator__minus {
    display: block;
}
```

When you do so, you should see the indicator change to minus when the accordion is open:

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

That's it for building the accordion. Now, let's look at adding some JavaScript functionality to open and close the accordion.

## Opening the accordion with JavaScript

One way to open the accordion is to listen for a click on the accordion indicator (the plus/minus sign). That's what you'd think immediately, but that's not the best way.

A better way is to allow the entire header to become a click-able element so users have a larger surface area to trigger the accordion.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

This means you can switch the `.accordion__header` from a `<div>` to an `<button>` element. The `<button>` element works great here because you're revealing content with JavaScript.

```html
<button class="accordion__header"> ... </button>
```

Since accordions don't come alone, you need to listen to all of them at once. One way to do so is through `querySelectorAll`.

```html
<button class="accordion__header jsAccordionHeader">
```

```js
const accordionHeaders = document.querySelectorAll('.jsAccordionHeader')
```

Once you've select your headers, you want to add an event listener to each of them. When the header is clicked, you want to add an `is-open` class to the `.accordion`, which is the parent element of the header. You can traverse to the parent element with parentNode.

```js
accordionHeaders.forEach(header => {
  header.addEventListener('click', _ => {
    header.classList.toggle('is-open')
  })
})
```

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

## A better event listener

The `querySelectorAll` methods work incredibly well if you're starting out. But, as you have read in the event delegation lessons, if you use `querySelectorAll` to add event listeners, you're adding too many event listeners. It works if you only need to linsen for a few elements, but the generally better way is to use the delegation pattern.

To use the delegation pattern, you need to listen to an ancestor element that contains all your accordion headers. This ancestor element should be as close as possible to your accordions.

In this demo, I grouped the accordions into an `.accordion-container` element, so `.accordion-container` is a better element to use as the delegator as opposed to the `<body>` tag.

```html
<div class="accordion-container jsAccordionContainer"> ... </div>
```

```js
const accordionContainer = document.querySelector('.jsAccordionContainer')
accordionContainer.addEventListener('click', e => {
  // Do something here
})
```

In the delegator (the `accordionContainer`), you want to listen for a `click` event on the `.jsAccordionHeader` elements. There are a few ways to do so. But first, let's take a look at what `event.target` returns.

```js
accordionContainer.addEventListener('click', e => {
  console.log(e.target)
})
```

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

As you can see, `event.target` returns the element that was clicked. If you click on the indicator, `event.target` returns the SVG element itself. If you click on the accordion title, it returns the accordion title.

This is a problem for us because we want to listen to a `click` event on each `.jsAccordionHeader`, not any element within `.jsAccordion` (especially not those within the accordion content!).

What to do? There are two ways to solve this problem.

**Method 1: pointer-events**

The first method is to add `pointer-events: none;` to every element within `.accordion__header`. You can read about `pointer-events` in the [event delegation lesson](../04.events/06.event-delegation.md).

```css
.accordion__header * {
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

...

**Method 2: Element.closest**
