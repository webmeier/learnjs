# Asynchronous functions

Asynchronous functions are functions with the `async` keyword. They let you use an `await` keyword that waits for promises to resolve. This `await` keyword helps you write asynchronous code as if they're synchronous.

## Declaring asynchronous functions

You declare asynchronous functions with an `async` keyword. The `async` keyword must be placed before the `function` keyword.

```js
// Function declaration
async function anAsyncFunction () { /* Do stuff here */ }

// Function expression
const anAsyncFunction = async function () { /* Do stuff here */ }
```

You can also create asynchronous functions with the arrow function syntax. In this case, you write `async` before the arguments.

```js
const anAsyncFunction = async (arg1, arg2) => { /* Do stuff here */ }
```

## Using asynchronous functions

You call asynchronous functions like normal functionsâ€”write the name of the function, followed by parenthesis.

```js
// Calling an async function
anAsyncFunction()
```

Asynchronous functions always return a promise.

```js
const anAsyncFunction = async _ => { /* Do stuff here */ }

const promise = anAsyncFunction()
console.log(promise)
```

This means you can treat asynchronous functions like promises. If you return a value from an asynchronous function, you can use that value in the next `then` call.

```js
const asyncSum = async (num1, num2) => num1 + num2

asyncSum(5, 10)
  .then(result => console.log(result)) // 15
```

## The await keyword

The `await` keyword is where the magic happens. It waits for a promise to resolve before doing anything else.

Let's say we send a Fetch request for a list of my repositories. This is how we write the Fetch request if we use promises.

```js
fetch('https://api.github.com/users/zellwk/repos')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(repos => console.log(repos))
```

We can perform the same Fetch request with asynchronous functions. To do so, we first create an asynchronous function.

We can place the promise in the asynchronous function and it'll work the same way.

```js
const fetchRepo = async link => {
  return fetch(link)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(repos => console.log(repos))
}

fetchRepo('https://api.github.com/users/zellwk/repos')
```

Since Fetch returns a promise, we can use `await` to let the promise resolve. The response passed into first `then` call can be transferred into a declared variable.

```js
const fetchRepo = async link => {
  const response = await fetch(link)
}

fetchRepo('https://api.github.com/users/zellwk/repos')
```

Try logging `response` into the console. You'll see that it's the same `response` that is returned from a Fetch request.

We kno we need to call `response.json` to get the repos. Since `response.json` returns a promise, we can wait for the promise to resolve with another `await` keyword.

```js
const fetchRepo = async link => {
  const response = await fetch(link)
  const repos = await response.json()
}

fetchRepo('https://api.github.com/users/zellwk/repos')
```

If you log `repos`, you'll see a list of 30 repositories.

## Handling errors

`await` waits for the promise to resolve. It waits for the `then` call. This means we're going to get an error message if promise goes into a `catch` call.

For example, let's say we tried to `await` for `errorPromise`, a promise that always throws an error.

```js
const errorPromise = _ => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    reject(Error('Something went wrong!'))
  })
}

const asyncFunction = async _ => {
  const res = await errorPromise()
}

asyncFunction()
```

</figure>

We will get an `Uncaught (in promise Error)` message in our console. This "uncaught" message means an error escaped our code. The console is warning us about our mistake.

We can to use a `try/catch` block to handle errors in an asynchronous function. A `try/catch` block looks like this:

```js
try {
  // Try something that may cause an error
} catch (error) {
  // Do something if an error occurs
}
```

When you `await` a promise, you don't know if the promise resolve or reject. This means `await` should always go into the `try` block.

If an error occurs, the error will be caught by the `catch` block.

```js
const asyncFunction = async _ => {
  try {
    const res = await errorPromise()
  } catch(error) {
    console.log(error) // Something went wrong!
  }
}
```

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2018/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

The `try` block works like this: it executes code from top to bottom, left to right (like normal). When it encounters an error, it skips the rest of the code and goes straight to the `catch` block.

```js
const asyncFunction = async _ => {
  try {
    const res = await errorPromise()
    console.log('JavaScript will never read this line of code!')
  } catch(error) {
    console.log(error) // Something went wrong!
  }
}
```

## The promise catcher

Error handling with `try/catch` works, but it makes the code harder to digest. We don't want to write `try/catch` blocks for every asynchronous function we write. It would be horrible!

```js
const asyncFunction1 = async (arg1, arg2) {
  try {
    // Do something
  } catch (e) {
    // Catch the error
  }
}

const asyncFunction2 = async (arg1, arg2) {
  try {
    // Do something
  } catch (e) {
    // Catch the error
  }
}

const asyncFunction3 = async (arg1, arg2) {
  try {
    // Do something
  } catch (e) {
    // Catch the error
  }
}
```

Since asynchronous functions return promises, we can use a `catch` call to handle errors. This lets us write asynchronous functions without worrying about `try/catch`.

```js
const asyncFunction = async _ => {
  const res = await errorPromise()
}

asyncFunction()
  .catch(e => console.log(e)) // Error: Something went wrong!
```

## Exercise

1. Use asynchronous functions to fetch list of your repositories
2. Handle async errors with the try/catch block.
3. Handle async errors with a Promise `catch` call.
