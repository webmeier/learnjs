# Dealing with paginated responses (part 1)

When you request for a list of items, many APIs respond with an incomplete list. For example, Github sends you 30 repositories even if the user has more than 30 repositories.

If you want to fetch all repositories, you can do two things:

1. Increase the number of items per request
2. Make more requests

Warning: this lesson is can feel quite advanced. Read it slowly. Work through the code slowly. You can understand what we're doing with everything you learned so far.

## Increasing the number of items per request

Most APIs let you change the number of items you get per request. For example, Github lets you get up to 100 items. To do so, you change the `per_page` query parameter.

If the user has more than 100 repositories, Github will send you the first 100 repositories. If the user has less than 100 repositories, Github will send you every repository the user has.

```js
fetch('https://api.github.com/users/zellwk/repos?per_page=100')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(repos => console.log(repos))
```

How you change the number of items per request, and how many items you can get per request depends on the API. Read their documentation.

## Making more requests

Sometimes you need to make more than one request. How you make the extra requests depends on whether the API tells you how many pages you need to fetch.

Some APIs tell you the number of pages through a Link header. Github is one example.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2018/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

Some APIs may not tell you any information at all. (You'll learn how to handle these APIs in the next lesson).

## Using the link header

We need to fish out the information from the link header. Before we do that, make sure you can access the link header.

Here's how you do it with XHR.

```js
// Getting link header with XHR
request.addEventListener('load', e => {
  const linkHeader = request.getRequestHeader('link')
})
```

Here's how you do it with Fetch.

```js
fetch('some-url')
  .then(r => {
    const headers = Array.from(r.headers.entries())
      .reduce((accumulator, [header, value]) => {
        return Object.assign(accumulator, {
         [header]: value
        })
      }, {})

    return r.json()
      .then(body => ({ headers, body }))
  })
  .then(response => {
    const linkHeader = response.headers.link
  })
```

(See the previous lesson if you need help with either method).

## Parsing the link header

If you examine the link header carefully, you'll see a pattern. There are two parts to this link header.

1. The link to the next page
2. The link to the last page

These two links are separated by a comma.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2018/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

You can also see that links to the next page (and last page) share another pattern.

1. Each link is wrapped with angled brackets.
2. The `rel` tells us which page the link leads to.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2018/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

These two groups of patterns, tell us we can convert the link header into a JavaScript object that looks like this:

```js
const parsedLinkHeader = {
  next: 'a link',
  last: 'another link'
}
```

To parse the link header, you need to know two methods:

1. `split`
2. `replace`

### split

`split` lets you split a string into two or more parts. These parts will be stored as an array.

```js
const array = string.split(separator, limit)
```

`separator` is the character(s) you use to split up a string.

`limit` lets you control the number of splits to make. You won't use the `limit` argument most of the time.

Here's an example:

```js
const string = 'My name is Zell'
const array = string.split(' ')

console.log(array)
// ['My', 'name', 'is', 'Zell']
```

### replace

`replace` lets you replace parts of a string with other characters.

```js
const replaced = string.replace(partToBeReplaced, replacer)
```

`partToBeReplaced` is the character(s) you want to replace.

`replacer` is the characters you want to replace with.

Here's an example:

```js
const string = 'My name is Zell'
const replaced = string.replace('Zell', 'Vincy')

console.log(replaced) // My name is Vincy
```

### Back to parsing the link header

First, we want to split the link header into two parts:

1. The "next" part
2. The "last" part

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2018/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

We can do this with `split`.

```js
const parts = linkHeader.split(',')

console.log(parts)
// [
//
//
// ]
```

We want to split each part again. This time with `;`. This lets us separate each part into the `link` and the `rel`.

Here's how splitting the first part would look like:

```js
const firstPart = parts[0]
const [link, rel] = firstPart.split(';')

console.log(link) //
console.log(rel) //
```

We need to remove angled brackets from the link. We can do this with `replace`. Here, we'll use an empty string as the replacer. We'll also want to use `trim` to remove any unwanted spaces.

```js
const removedLeftBracket = link.replace('<', '')
const removedRightBracket = removedLeftBracket.replace('>', '')
const trimmed = removedRightBracket.trim()
```

These three steps can be grouped into one.

```js
const formattedLink = link.replace('<', '').replace('>', '').trim()

console.log(formattedLink) //
```

We also want to remove `rel"` and `"` from `rel`. We'll follow the same method.

```js
const formattedRel = rel.replace('rel="', '').replace('"', '').trim()

console.log(formattedRel) // next
```

Once we've formatted `link` and `rel`, we can create an object that gives us information about the next link.

```js
const parsedFirstPart = {
  [formattedRel]: formattedLink
}

console.log(parsedFirstPart.next)
// { next: }
```

We want to the everything with done so far with the second part as well. The process is the same. I've created a function for you to speed things up.

Go through the function and make sure you understand what it is doing.

```js
const parseLinkHeader = linkHeader => {
  const parts = linkHeader.split(',')
  return parts.reduce((acc, part) => {
    const [l, r] = part.split(';')
    const link = l.replace('<', '').replace('>', '').trim()
    const rel = r.replace('rel="', '').replace('"', '').trim()
    return Object.assign(acc, { [rel]: link })
  }, {})
}

// Usage
const parsedLink = parseLinkHeader(linkHeader)
```

## Getting the page number

Let's say your parsed link header looks like this:

```js
const parsedLinkHeader = {
  'last': 'some-url?page=5',
  'next': 'some-url?page=2'
}
```

We need to know the value of `page`. To get the value of `page`, we can use `URLSearchParams`.

### URLSearchParams

`URLSearchParams` helps us with with query parameters. To use `URLSearchParams`, we need to write `new URLSearchParams`. We also need to pass in the query string.

```js
const searchParams = new URLSearchParams('?page=5')
```

We can get the `page` value with the `get` method.

```js
const page = searchParams.get('page')
console.log(page) // 5
```

### Back to getting the page number

This means we need to split our string again. This time, we split with `?`. We only need the second part of the split because it contains the query string.

```js
const queryString = parsedLinkHeader.last.split('?')[1]
const searchParams = new URLSearchParams(queryString)
const lastPage = searchParams.get('page')

console.log(lastPage) // 5
```

## Fetching many requests at once

We're going to use the `Promise.all` process you learned in a previous lesson to fetch many requests at once.

In this case, `lastPage` is 5. We know the API has five pages. We also know we need to fetch pages 2 to 5.

In other words, we need to fetch 4 more pages.

```js
const numRequests = lastPage - 1
```

# Should talk about promises and loops. Just to make things clearer.

We need to make an array with four items. One way to make this new array is through a `for` loop.

```js
let array = []

for (let index )
```


In this case, we need to fetch four requests.

We need to know how many requests we need to make.

Once we have the last page, we can construct an array of requests. We can create an array that contains the number of requests we want to make.

```js
const numRequests = page - 1
const array = Array.from({length: numRequests})

console.log(array) // [undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined]
```

Let me explain why this code works. It's a clever piece of code. With `length: numRequests`, we trick Array.from, thinking that it should convert an array-like object into an array. The length tells `Array.from` how many objects to create.

Note: credits to [this stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3746725/create-a-javascript-array-containing-1-n?page=1&tab=votes#tab-top).

Anyway I'm done overcomplicating things. THis is supposed to be a complicated thing any.

We can fetch each item with `fetch`. To do so, we can use `map` to create.

```js
const requests = requests.map((value, index) => {
  fetch(`some-url?page=${index + 2}`)
    .then(r => r.json())
})

Promise.all(requests)
  .then(repos => {
    console.log(repos) //
  })
```

You will get back an array of arrays. Since each request returns an array.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2018/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

You'll have to flatten the arrays together. To do so, you can use `reduce`.

```js
Promise.all(requests)
  .then(responses => {
    const flattened = responses.reduce(
      (acc, repos) => [...acc, ...repos]
    )

    console.log(flattened)
  })
```

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2018/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

Then you do something with your repos. Whatever you want!
