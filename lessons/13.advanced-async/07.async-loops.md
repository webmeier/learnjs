# Asynchronous loops

You need to be aware of some gotchas when using `await` in a loop. Let's run through three different loops and see what the gotchas are.

We're going to go through:

1. The basic `for` loop
2. The `forEach` loop
3. The `map` loop

## Creating the experiment

We're going to loop through an array that contains three items.

```js
const array = [5, 10, 15]
```

In each iteration, we will `await` something that returns a promise. For this experiment, we will use a promisified timeout to simulate this promise.

In the real world, we wouldn't use a promisified timeout. We would use something like the Fetch API instead. We're going to use the promisified timeout because we control how fast each item resolves. This lets us have a better idea what real asynchronosinity looks like, magnified to the amount we require. So I can say a fetch API resolves in less than a second. We can't really tell what happens if three Fetch requests resolve within one second. Do they resolve at the same time, or do they resolve in a specific sequence?

If we use a promisified timeout, we can control how fast the promise resolves. This gives us time and space to understand how `await` works with loops.

Here's the promisified timeout function once again. I should just call it the `delay` function.

```js
const delay = (duration, value) => {
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(value), duration))
}
```

## A normal for loop

As we mentioned earlier, we're going to loop through a actually I don't even need to mention the above experiment. I'm just going to do it and explain as I go along. That'll be much much easier.

Let's say we have an array of usernames.

```js
const usernames = [5, 10, 15]
```

We want to loop through this array of items in an asyncchronous function. It'll look like this.

```js
const forLoop = async _ => {
  for (let index = 0; index < usernames.length; index++) {
    const item = usernames[index]
    console.log(item)
  }
}

forLoop()
```

The `for` loop in this example behaves like a normal for loop because we haven't added the `await` keyword.

Let's add the `await` keyword next. Say we want to fetch three people's Github repositories. We're going to use the repositories yeah, the earlier will be github arrount. We're going to use the following code:

```js
const forLoop = async _ => {
  for (let index = 0; index < usernames.length; index++) {
    const username = usernames[index]
    const repos = zlFetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${username}/repos`)
    console.log(item)
  }
}

forLoop()
```

When you run the `for` loop, You'll see three `console.log` statements. It'll log one by one.

I should probably explain why it waits before continuing. But I am rather lazy right now so I'm going to skip it. I believe I'll be able to do it next time. But next time? That'll have to wait till the following week. I suppose that's okay. Let me continue for now.

The duration for each Fetch request is different. If you're on a super good internet, you might complete each  request in half a second. If have shitty internet, you might complete each request in three seconds.

Not very ideal for a learning environment.

What we're going to do is substitute the Fetch request with a promisified timeout. This lets us control:

1. The amount of time it takes to complete the request
2. The results returned from the request

This process is called mocking. It means substituting something real for something fake for testing purposes.

We're going to use the `delay` function we created in the previous lesson as the mock promise.

```js
const delay = (duration, value) => {
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(value), duration))
}
```

We're going to substitute `zlFetch` with `delay`. We're going to wait for 1000 milliseconds (1 second) for each request. The result of the request will be the string `Fetched ${username}!`

```js
const forLoop = async _ => {
  for (let index = 0; index < usernames.length; index++) {
    const username = usernames[index]
    const result = delay(1000, `Fetched ${username}!`)
    console.log(result)
  }
}

forLoop()
```

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2018/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

Next, if we log a string, `done`, after the `for` loop. It'll appear after all usernames are "fetched". This is quite expected.

```js
const forLoop = async _ => {
  for (let index = 0; index < usernames.length; index++) {
    const username = usernames[index]
    const result = delay(1000, `Fetched ${username}!`)
    console.log(result)
  }

  console.log('done')
}

forLoop()
```

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2018/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

The `for...of` loop will behave the same way with `await` compared to the `for` loop. So we won't go into that.

## The forEach loop

Let's do the same thing above with the `forEach` loop.

Here's the code you may write initially:

```js
const forEachLoop = async _ => {
  usernames.forEach(username => {
    const result = delay(1000, `Fetched ${username}!`)
    console.log(result)
  })

  console.log('done')
}

forEachLoop()
```

The first thing you'll realize is that this code gives an error message that says XXX.

This error occurs because `await` can only be used in an asynchronous function. The callback provided to `forEach` is not an asynchronous function now.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2018/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

We can fix this error by adding the `async` keyword to the callback.

```js
const forEachLoop = async _ => {
  usernames.forEach(username => {
    const result = delay(1000, `Fetched ${username}!`)
    console.log(result)
  })

  console.log('done')
}

forEachLoop()
```

Watch what happens if you run the function this time.

The `forEach` loop executes differently compared to the `forLoop`. If you run the code, you'll notice two things:

1. `done` appears before the usernames
2. usernames are logged at the same time, not sequentially

### Why done appears first

When JavaScript sees `forEach`, it realizes that forEach is a method that calls a callback. It loops through the every username in `usernames` and calls `delay`.

But since the callback is an asynchronous function, JavaScript throws the thing into the Event loop. It lets the event loop handle the callbacks.

If we refer back to the Butler analogy when we're talk about the Event loop, this is what happens.

</figure>

Um. Yeah. I cannot visualize that yet, but it's good enough for now I guess.

Once JavaScript executes `forEach`, it moves on to the next line. This line is `done`. That's why JavaScript logs `done` first.

### Why the three usernames are logged together

When JavaScript runs `forEach`, the three `delay` functions are called one after another in rapid succession (at the speed where JavaScript loops through the usermanes array).

We can count this in milliseconds. They're too fast for our human eyes to catch. THat's why they seem to appear together.

But what happens is what I just explained. It loops, and for each loop, it fires the `delay`. JavaScript doesn't wait for the previous loop to complete before firing the next loop, unlike a normal `for` loop.

Let's move on to looping with `map`.

## Map

`map` works like `forEach`. But with `map`, you return a new array. If you use `map`, you'd want to return the fetched.

```js
const forEachLoop = async _ => {
  const promises = usernames.map(username => {
    const result = await delay(1000, `Fetched ${username}!`)
    console.log(result)
    return result
  })

  console.log('done')
}

forEachLoop()
```

What you'll see is the same as if you did a `forEach` loop.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2018/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

But there are differences.

For example, if you log `promises` into the console, you can see that it's an array of promises.

This means, if you want to do something with the promises before you execute `done`, you can use another `await` keyword.

```js
const forEachLoop = async _ => {
  const promises = usernames.map(username => {
    const result = await delay(1000, `Fetched ${username}!`)
    console.log(result)
    return result
  })

  const results = await Promise.all(promises)
  console.log(results)
  console.log('done')
}

forEachLoop()
```

You'll see that each item in `results` is the result you returned in the `map` loop.

Cool so far... but I kinda need to redo the thing to see the actual effect now because I'm a little stuck on what to write next.

What I want to write next is this: uhh you return something in promises. But that means you don't need to await in the map anymore. You can simply return the promise. Because it's a promise anyway. Unless you want to change the value, of course.

```js
const promises = usernames.map(username => await delay(1000, `Fetched ${username}!`)
})
```

This way, you only execute the promises when you run `Promise.all`. No actually the promises are already executed. So there's no need to await them. It's pretty much the same. Since await returns a promise, you don't need to convert the result from a promise into a value and back into a promise again.

A more succint way of doing the above would be to return the promise directly. And then the code.

Note: You can't use `Promise.all` with `await` in the `forEach` loop because `forEach` doesn't return anything.

But uh reduce yes? Reduce I need to check.

## Exercise

1. Use `await` in a `for` loop
2. Use `await` in a `forEach` loop
3. Use `await` with `map`
  1. Use `Promise.all` to resolve the promises that is returned in your map.
