# Requesting many resources at once

You may find yourself requesting many resources at once. This lesson will show you how to make such requests with both XHR and Fetch.

We're going to keep it simple (and conceptual).

Let's say you want to serve a meal. To serve this meal, you need to fetch three resources. All three resources must be ready before you can serve the meal.

The three resources are:

1. A burger
2. A pack of fries
3. A drink

(Substitute burger, fries, and drink with three Github requests if you want a real example).

## Requesting many resources with XHR

We need events to fetch resources with XHR. If we want three resources, we can use three event listeners.

```js
const burgerRequest = new XMLHttpRequest()
const friesRequest = new XMLHttpRequest()
const drinkRequest = new XMLHttpRequest()

burgerRequest.addEventListener('load', e => { /* Burger's ready! */ })
burgerRequest.open('GET', 'Burger Link')
burgerRequest.send()

friesRequest.addEventListener('load', e => { /* Fries' ready! */ })
friesRequest.open('GET', 'Fries Link')
friesRequest.send()

drinkRequest.addEventListener('load', e => { /* Drink's ready! */ })
drinkRequest.open('GET', 'Drink Link')
drinkRequest.send()
```

There's a problem with the above approach—we don't know when all our resources return from the server. We only know about one resource in each event listener.

One way to get all three resources is to wait for a response before sending the next request out. That means:

1. Send request for burger.
2. Wait for burger to be ready
3. Send request for fries
4. Wait for fries to be ready
5. Send request for drink
6. Wait for drink to be ready.

Here's what it might look like:

```js
burgerRequest.addEventListener('load', e => {
  // Burger is ready! Send request for fries now!
  const burger = e.target

  const friesRequest = new XMLHttpRequest()
  friesRequest.addEventListener('load', e => {
    // Fries is ready! Send request for drink now!
    const fries = e.target

    const drinkRequest = new XMLHttpRequest()
    drinkRequest.addEventListener('load', e => {
      const drink = e.target
      serveMeal(burger, fries, drink)
    })
    drinkRequest.open('GET', 'Drink Link')
    drinkRequest.send()
  })
  friesRequest.open('GET', 'Fries Link')
  friesRequest.send()
})
```

There are two problems.

First, we sent one request when another request completes. This means we're wasting time if burger, fries and drinks can be requested independently.

Second, the code is confusing and complicated. We have callbacks in callbacks. This nested callback pattern is often called callback hell. We want to avoid callback hell.

The ideal solution to fetching many requests at once lies with promises.

Note: Axios lets you use promises even if you use XHR.

## Promise.all

The `Promise` constructor has a method called `all`. `all` takes in an array of promises. It waits for all promises to resolve or reject calling `then` or `catch`.

```js
Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])
  .then(results => { /* Do something with results */ })
  .catch(error => { /* Do something with the errors */})
```

The argument sent to `then` or `catch` is an array from each promise.

```js
Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])
  .then([result1, result2, result3] => {
    // Do something with each result
  })
```

Here's what our code might look like if we use promises to fetch `burger`, `fries` and `drink`.

```js
const burgerPromise = getBurger()
const friesPromise = getFries()
const drinkPromise = getDrink()

const serveMeal = Promise.all([
  burgerPromise,
  friesPromise,
  drinkPromise
])
  .then([burger, fries, drink] => {
    console.log(`${burger} 🍔`)
    console.log(`${fries} 🍟`)
    console.log(`${drink} 🍹`)
  })
```

## Requesting many resources with Fetch

You have two ways to fetch burger, fries and drink with Fetch.

### Method 1

The first method is to call three Fetch requests with `Promise.all`.

In the first `then` call, you need to transform each response into JSON. Since `response.json` returns a promise, you need to use another `Promise.all`.

```js
const burgerPromise = fetch('burger link')
const friesPromise = fetch('fries link')
const drinkPromise = fetch('drink link')

Promise.all([
  burgerPromise,
  friesPromise,
  drinkPromise
])
  .then(([burgerResponse, friesResponse, drinkResponse]) => {
    return Promise.all([
      burgerResponse.json(),
      friesResponse.json(),
      drinkResponse.json()
    ])
  })
  .then(([burger, fries, drink]) => {
    console.log(`${burger} 🍔`)
    console.log(`${fries} 🍟`)
    console.log(`${drink} 🍹`)
  })
```

### Method 2

The second method is to make the first `then` calls when requesting each resource.

Then, use `Promise.all` to handle the responses. Each Fetch request will resolves their first `then` call when they're ready.

```js
const burgerPromise = fetch('burger link')
  .then(r => r.json())
const friesPromise = fetch('fries link')
  .then(r => r.json())
const drinkPromise = fetch('drink link')
  .then(r => r.json())

Promise.all([
  burgerPromise,
  friesPromise,
  drinkPromise
])
  .then(([burger, fries, drink]) => {
    console.log(`${burger} 🍔`)
    console.log(`${fries} 🍟`)
    console.log(`${drink} 🍹`)
  })
```

## Requesting many resources with zlFetch

zlFetch writes the first `then` call for you. That means it you'll use method 2 automatically.

```js
Promise.all([
  zlFetch('burger link')
  zlFetch('fries link')
  zlFetch('drink link')
])
  .then(([burger, fries, drink]) => {
    console.log(`${burger} 🍔`)
    console.log(`${fries} 🍟`)
    console.log(`${drink} 🍹`)
  })
```

## Exercise

Do this:

1. Make three different requests at once with XHR
2. Make three different requests at once with Fetch
3. Make three different requests at once with zlFetch or Axios
