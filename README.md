## Welcome to JavaScript Fundamentals!

In JavaScript Fundamentals (let's call it JSF), you'll learn how to take your JavaScript skills from a novice to a ninja.

You'll learn the necessary lessons, you'll build stuff.

This private Github repo is a temporary place for you to read the lessons. I want to make this first, and give you access to the lessons before creating a portal. I want to give you access first, so you can learn without waiting for the course to be completely ready.

## Here's how JSF is structured

JSF is split into two parts â€“ Web and Core.

In the Web lessons folder, you'll find everything you need to know about JavaScript on the web.

In the Core lessons folder, you'll learn about the JavaScript language. These are things that work both in the browser and in Node.js

## How to read this course

If your JavaScript basics (like loops, closures, arrays, etc) are shaky, you'd want to begin by reading the basics of JavaScript in the Core lessons.

Here are the ready chapters:

1. Basics
    1. [For loop](core/01.basics/12.for-loops.md)

Once your JavaScript basics are firm, you'd want to begin reading the Web lessons.

Here's are the ready chapters:

1. Dom Basics
    1. [Dom and Bom](lessons/02.dom-basics/01.dom-and-bom.md)
    2. [Selecting an element](lessons/02.dom-basics/02.selecting-an-element.md.md)
    3. [Changing style](lessons/02.dom-basics/03.changing-style.md)
    4. [Selecting multiple elements](lessons/04.dom-basics/04.selecting-multiple-elements.md)
    5. [Nodes vs Elements](lessons/02.dom-basics/05.nodes-vs-elements.md)
    6. [Changing classes](lessons/02.dom-basics/06.changing-classes.md)
    7. [Changing attributes](lessons/02.dom-basics/07.changing-attributes.md)

Then, as and when you encounter advanced lessons, you'll want to read more about them.

Here are the ready chapters:

3. Advanced Arrays
    1. [Array.forEach](core/03.advanced-arrays/04.foreach.md)

## Slack Channel

Since you pre-ordered JSF, you have access to the Slack channel to learn together with your peers. To join the slack channel, head over to [this link]() and fill in your best email.

You'll get an invitation to join a Slack group. Once you've signed in, send me a private message and I'll add you to the jsf-preorder Slack channel. It's secret, only for awesome people like you.

## Questions?

If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in two ways:

1. Create a new issue. Ask it there, adding as much detail as you can to the question. Here's [some guidelines](https://zellwk.com/blog/asking-questions/) to help you craft good questions.
2. Ask them directly in the Slack channel. This way, your peers can answer it for you as well.

Note: If you happen to know an answer to a question in Slack, it is to your benefit to answer the question. This is because we learn best when we teach. If someone else can understand your explanation, it means you've understood the concept.

## Lesson Updates

I'll push new lessons to this repo whenever they're ready for you. Make sure you watch the repo if you want the latest updates. I'll also send you an email and ping you on slack.

## Spot a typo?

If you spot any typo, I would really appreciate it if you help correct it by sending a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

Here's why you should take a minute do so:

1. You'll be improving your JavaScript skills faster if you manage to spot typos. When you fix them, you gain the skill to spot your own typos.
2. Typos confuse people, especially when the typo is code-related. If you spot the typo, you'd help me make it easier for the rest of your peers. Likewise, if others spot the typo, they'll make it easier for you to go through the course.
