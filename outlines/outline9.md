Notes to self about new outline:

1. Remove Array parts other than `indexOf` and looping through arrays from the actual array stuff now. Because not used
2. Manipulating Arrays
  1. Add this after Forms.
  2. Adding to arrays and removing from arrays will all go here.
  3. Talk about mutation
  4. Talk about map and forEach and other array methods
  5. Show how to use `.map` and `.join` and show `innerHTML` method for creating items.
  6. Show how to create tasklist with `innerHTML`.
3. Change Animations into Basic Animations.
4. Add Advanced animations section farther below. After Component Integration.
5. SHift dealing with dates after advanced animations. This will be one of the final components.
6. Talk about scroll and resize events before Ajax.
7. Shift drag/drop after Component integration.
8. OOP... Might need to shift up.
