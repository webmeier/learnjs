Asynchronous JavaScript
1. Introduction to Ajax
2. Understanding JSON
3. The Fetch API
4. Data Types
5. JavaScript Promises
6. Requests and responses
7. Sending post requests
8. Authentication
9. Handling errors
10. CORS and JSONP
11. XHR or Fetch?
12. Using an Ajax library
  1. What is Axios
  2. Get request with Axios
  3. Post request with Axios
  4. Handling errors with Axios
13. Understanding API Documentations
  1. How to read API documentations
  2. API Versions
  3. API Headers, response, request, etc
14. Understanding CURL
  1. Why need to understand CURL
  2. Sending a request with CURL
    1. Setting method
    2. Setting headers
    3. Setting body (with and without line breaks)
  3. Basic Auth with CURL
  4. Verbose mode (for reading response headers)
15. Building some components:
  1. Building a loading indicator
  2. Build a Pok√©dex
  3. A Google Maps component (requires an API key for auth)

Advanced asynchronous JavaScript
1. Advanced Promises (Then then then chain. Promise.all)
2. Requesting many resources at once (I can talk purely about Promises here. Forget Callbacks! Yay!)
3. Promises and loops (for loop vs map. Promises must be returned to be used )
4. Using Response headers
5. Parsing Strings
6. Dealing with paginated responses (parts 1 and 2) Same. Only talk about promises.
7. Async and await
  1. The async function
  2. The await keyword
  3. Always return promises
8. Catching errors with Async/await.
  1. Try catch
  2. The Error catcher pattern
9. Awaiting many items at once
10. Async/await and loops
11. Improving components we build
