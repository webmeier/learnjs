    3. Parent-child Flips
        1. What happens (https://codepen.io/zellwk/pen/WKyKje)
        1. Direct flip
            1. Reverse scale (1 / scale) for children items
            2. Note that padding and margins also scale... so if whitespace is a concern, don't scale at all!
        2. Two-step opacity flip
            1. Children get opacity 0 first.
            2. Once parent flipped properly, reveal children.
    4. Examples

Extra thoughts that I haven't managed to consolidate.

String manipulation

    3. Creating calculator (advanced)

## Notes to self:

Might be good to teach these:
    1. `pop`,
    2. `push`
    3. `while` loop

In MVP, the P observes models and updates views when models change. The P effectively binds models to views, a responsibility which was previously held by controllers in MVC.

MVVM = two-way data binding
