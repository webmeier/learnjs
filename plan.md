# Plan of attack

What I'm going to write about next:

1. Todolist Ajax (Debounce and spinners)
2. Todolist Ajax (Edit and delete)
3. Autocomplete Ajax
4. Google Maps component Ajax
5. Scroll and browser resize events

Gonna make this work!

Some adjustments to be made during this duration:

1. Move Scroll/Resize events before Best practices.
  1. Can make more best practice lessons
  2. Entice people to buy the beginner package more if they're not interested in the intermediate stuff

Ajax debounce gonna work this way:

1. Once click / Enter, the submit button will spin. When the spinner is spinning, you can't add anything else. Wait till the spinner completes the spinning. Woo! Then there's no need to debounce üòè.
2. For edit/delete, the spinner will be added to the right as an indicator. As before, spinner will spin finish before the animations begin. But since there are no animations, I'm going to forget about it. I still want to add an advanced animations section though. Not sure if possible. But will try later on. It's not of utmost priority now.
3. Autocomplete, will simply just fetch. Will have this before Todolist.
4. Google Maps component will require more info and planning to make it happen. Might take a few weeks I think.

Extra stuff to do:

1. Read form design book
2. Read PWA (before working on PWA lessons)
3. Gather info about accessibility.

Note to self: The act of putting pixels on the DOM Is called Rendering
