# On Semicolons

Have you noticed that some books and tutorials advocate you add semicolons to the end of every line of JavaScript?

Yet, I have not done so in the course.

## Semicolons are optional

JavaScript inserts semicolons for you automatically. That is why semicolons are optional. You don't need semicolons to write good JavaScript.

In fact, it's easier to read and write JavaScript when you leave out the semicolons. Many experts have already done so.

I'd leave the explaining of why you don't need semicolons to [this article](https://feross.org/never-use-semicolons/). Have a read and you'll understand why.
