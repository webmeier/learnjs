# Debugging errors

To become a good developer, the #1 skill to learn is to be able to figure out what went wrong and make the necessary adjustments. This process is called **debugging**.

It doesn't matter whether you're a novice or an expert at JavaScript. You will make errors as you code.

When an error occurs, novices stare at the error. They wonder what went wrong, but their minds go blank. Experts, on the other hand, use the error messages to trace what's wrong. They fix the error and continue coding.

## How to debug

Debugging occurs when you notice something goes wrong. Sometimes, your cue would be an error message. At other times, you notice the results weren't what you expect.

Let's go through a simple example with an error message. Say you have the following code:

```js
const anObject = null
console.log(anObject.aProperty)
```

If you navigate to the Console tab in your developer tools, you'll see an error message:

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

To debug the error message, you follow these *five steps*:

1. Regain your composure
2. Read the error message
3. See where the error occurred
4. Console.log if necessary
5. Fix the error

**First, regain your composure**. It's normal to make mistakes when coding. You probably wrote a typo. Nothing is going to explode, so don't worry. Don't panic. Take deep breath and regain your composure.

**Second, read the error message**. Error messages contain valuable information that tells you what went wrong. In this case, the error says you can't read a property of `null`. This is a valid error because the `null` primitive cannot have properties. Only objects have properties.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

**Third, see where the error occurred**. The error message also tells you the origin of your error. In this case, the error originated from line #2 in `main.js`.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2017/" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

**Fourth, console.log if necessary**. Most of the time, errors are not as straightforward as our example here. You may not know how to fix the error message immediately.

For instance, let's say you don't know that `anObject` is `null` right now. Since you're uncertain whether `anObject` is really `null`, you can `console.log(anObject)` to see what it is.

Make sure you write your log statements before the offending line of code (since JavaScript stops executing when an error happens).

```js
console.log(anObject) // Checks in anObject is null
console.log(anObject.aProperty) // undefined
```

**Fifth, fix the error** once you've confirmed the cause of the error message. In this case, you can set `anObject` to an empty object and the error will go away.

```js
const anObject = {}
console.log(anObject.aProperty)
```

## Exercise

Is there an error with the following code? If yes, find out what it is and fix it.

```js
const anObject = {}
console.log(anObject.someMethod())
```
