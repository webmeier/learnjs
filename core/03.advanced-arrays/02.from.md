## Array.from

`Array.from` converts any iterable object (an object that has the Symbol.iterator property) into an array. Examples of iterable objects include NodeLists and HTML Collections.

(Most of the time, you'd only convert NodeLists and HTML Collections).

The syntax looks like this:

```js
const array = Array.from(object)
```

If you need to convert iterables into arrays for older browsers, you may need to use a polyfill for `Array.from`. You can find the polyfill on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from).
